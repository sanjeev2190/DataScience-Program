If between I\\'d probably go with your lower end i.e 8-8.5 go 8. I wore these right out of the box for a little over 2 hours, most of which was walking around and they were incredibly comfortable no rubbing and I did not find any issue with the tongue being too stiff as I have seen mentioned in other reviews. This is the second pair I bought. Loved the first pair however not pleased with the 2nd pair. There is no padding in the tongue part of the shoe and it is causing irritation to my skin where it rubs. I am very disappointed and will not buy them again. I love these shoes so much, it\\'s my second pair, pure comfort!  Thank you Amazon! I have hard to fit feet and often a wide fitting shoe looks too big and bulky.  These shoes were comfortable right away with no pressure points.  I use them for run around shoes, going to the store, etc.  They look casual but are more attractive than a running shoe.  They have a nice rounded toe box and go with any kind of outfit.  I am very happy with them. è¶³ã\\x81\\x8c22cmã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x82\\x81ã\\x80\\x81ã\\x81\\x93ã\\x81®ã\\x82µã\\x82¤ã\\x82ºã\\x82\\x92å±\\x95é\\x96\\x8bã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81¦ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x83\\x96ã\\x83©ã\\x83³ã\\x83\\x89ã\\x81\\x8cå°\\x91ã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x8fè³¼å\\x85¥ã\\x80\\x82ã\\x83\\x87ã\\x82¶ã\\x82¤ã\\x83³ã\\x81¯å\\x8f¯æ\\x84\\x9bã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81¦æº\\x80è¶³ã\\x81\\xa0ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x80\\x81å±¥ã\\x81\\x8då¿\\x83å\\x9c°ã\\x81¯æ®\\x8bå¿µã\\x80\\x82å°\\x8fã\\x81\\x95ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x82µã\\x82¤ã\\x82ºã\\x81\\x82ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81\\x82ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81§ã\\x80\\x81ã\\x83\\x91ã\\x83¼ã\\x83\\x84ã\\x81¯å¤§ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x81\\x84ã\\x82µã\\x82¤ã\\x82ºã\\x81®ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x81®ã\\x82\\x92æµ\\x81ç\\x94¨ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81¦ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x82\\x88ã\\x81\\x86ã\\x81«æ\\x80\\x9dã\\x81\\x88ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x80\\x82ã\\x83»ã\\x83\\x99ã\\x83\\xadã\\x81\\x8cé\\x95·ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x81\\x8eã\\x81¦ã\\x80\\x81è¶³é¦\\x96ã\\x82\\x92æ\\x9b²ã\\x81\\x92ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81\\x9fã\\x81³ã\\x81«ã\\x81\\x93ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x82\\x8cã\\x81¦ã\\x80\\x81ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x82\\x8aå\\x82·ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x82\\x8bï¼\\x88ã\\x82¹ã\\x83\\x8bã\\x83¼ã\\x82«ã\\x83¼ã\\x82½ã\\x83\\x83ã\\x82¯ã\\x82¹ã\\x81§ã\\x81¯NGï¼\\x89ã\\x83»ã\\x82¤ã\\x83³ã\\x82½ã\\x83¼ã\\x83«ã\\x81®è¸µã\\x81\\x8bã\\x82\\x89å\\x9c\\x9fè¸\\x8fã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x9aã\\x81®ã\\x82¢ã\\x83¼ã\\x83\\x81ã\\x81¾ã\\x81§ã\\x81®è·\\x9dé\\x9b¢ã\\x81\\x8cé\\x95·ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x81\\x8eã\\x81¦ã\\x80\\x81ã\\x81¤ã\\x81¾å\\x85\\x88å¯\\x84ã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81«ã\\x82¢ã\\x83¼ã\\x83\\x81ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x9d¥ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81\\x9fã\\x82\\x81ã\\x80\\x81å¾\\x8cã\\x82\\x8dé\\x87\\x8då¿\\x83ã\\x81«æ\\x84\\x9fã\\x81\\x98ã\\x82\\x8bä»\\x8aå\\x9b\\x9eã\\x81¯é\\x9d´ä¸\\x8bã\\x82\\x84ä¸\\xadæ\\x95·ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x82\\x92å·¥å¤«ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81¦å±¥ã\\x81\\x93ã\\x81\\x86ã\\x81¨æ\\x80\\x9dã\\x81\\x86ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x80\\x81å\\x8f¯æ\\x84\\x9bã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81¦ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x83ªã\\x83\\x94ã\\x83¼ã\\x83\\x88ã\\x81¯ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x80\\x82 I really need 11 1/2 but these shoes do not come in half sizes.  My right foot fits size 11 fine but not the same for the left foot.  The only issue is the blue insole - my feet perspire and the blue colour runs into my socks.  Also, the round laces look nice but they do not remain tied; they need a knot in the bow to maintain the tie.  They are very attractive shoes and do not look huge in size 12. Thank you.

I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced. By the way my original pair that are 2 1/2 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them. I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that werenâ\\x80\\x99t grungy looking. I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me. I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale! What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery! Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking. Very well-made and beautiful and striking. I would NOT recommend these for running. They have zero support and I could feel the rocks in the ground through the shoe. They are also shaped really weird. The sole protrudes out in the back all around the heel and makes your foot appear much larger than it should. These shoes are cute online but in person...not so much.The shoe is super light weight and flimsy feeling.  Because of this, it feels as if there is no support/stability.My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe.The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted. As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and toe of the shoe to twist upward.  Not a nice look.  At that point I decided that I didn\\'t want to struggle with getting the shoe on each time.  I\\'m returning them. Very comfortable! Absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes. They run slightly too big. But, that doesn\\'t take away from the comfort. I\\'m not sliding around inside them. I\\'m able to work in them well and workout in them great. Excellent pair of shoes. I like the style and weight of this shoe, just right for wearing all day.  Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragonâ\\x80\\x99s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.  Dilemma, should I send them back or go buy 6 or 7 sets of insoles at the drug store to see if any of them will work.  So disappointing. The tongue is long, stiff, and rough. It rubs my ankles raw. I have been trying to find a casual, but not too casual, shoe for work. I wanted an athletic shoe fit in a shoe that doesn\\'t look like an athletic shoe. This is pretty close. It works well with chinos or colored denim. They would not look right with \"dress\" pants, but for business casual, it\\'s good. I\\'m always between 8 and 8.5. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I also need good support and these are reasonable. I have another pair of Aravon shoes (mary jane) and they also work well. I think this is good brand. I thought they were really cute and fit good but after I decided to wear them around for a day I mopped the floor like I Do every day and I almost slipped so the shoes will not be good for me and my lifestyle very slippery pretty much no tread it would be good for walking as long as youâ\\x80\\x99re never honest with Service but I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to take my chances so back to Searching for a new pair of shoes I\\'d give them 5 stars if it weren\\'t for the fact that the material on the inside of the shoe keeps pulling on my socks, it\\'s not all the time, but it\\'s frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up which find their way down into my shoes after walking for 10-15 min, also the laces don\\'t seem to stay tied, my recommendation is to buy socks that are really snug around your ankles and use a different pair of laces.... besides that, I think the shoes are really cute, love the choice of brown and blue, I think they work well together, also the shoe has pretty good support, I use my own inserts which fit well in the shoe, but like I said if you don\\'t, the original inserts are pretty good I bought these as a birthday present for myself. I originally wanted to use them as my new jogging shoes. The tongue of the shoe is just too stiff for that though. I am still happy with the shoes cuz they are super cute. Besides the stiff tongue my only other complaint is they seem a tad larger than my other size tens. I have a little more space than I like to have. Otherwise completely awesome! I was so excited to find these shoes. They are super cute!  They were too small, however, and I cannot find the larger size I need.  When I tried them on, they were really stiff and a bit tight.  Who knows maybe they would stretch out as I wore them, but they just didn\\'t fit.  I am disappointed that I can\\'t find the size I need anywhere, but will keep looking. It\\'s a very comfortable and lightweight shoe.  I found it to be pretty true for a size 10, but all shoes run differently.  Other reviews said it ran small, but I didn\\'t find that the case. I bought the 10D width.  The wider width doesn\\'t look odd, it fits the shoe well and my foot. Two years ago I bought this same exact shoes.  I wore them always when choosing a stylish athletic shoe. Originally I bought them when our family was going to go to The Ark in Kentucky and knew we would be doing alot of walking.there has never been a time that my feet hurt when I wear these shoes. And I get compliments often as to how cute they look.  So best shoes for me for comfort and style! Bought them again to update and bought an additional pair in black. An sich wunderschÃ¶ner Schuh, auspacken und direkt meinem Kind angezogen. Das Kind geht 2 Schritte und fÃ¤ngt bitterlich an zu weinen... Sofort Schuhe ausgezogen und mal geschaut was da los ist. Es war nen fÃ¼r Kleinkinderschuhe wirklich groÃ\\x9fer Knick in der Inneneinlage der sich auch nicht wirklich begradigen lÃ¤sst. Bedauerlich, wo doch der Schuh an sich nicht im Discounter Sektor liegt. Da hÃ¤tte ich wirklich mehr erwartet. Auf einem der Fotos steht auf der Sohle die gr 26.Die Schuhe die mit verschickt wurden ist die Gr 19...Habe keine Antwort auf meine Frage vor einigen  Tagen bekommen welche GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe das tatsÃ¤chlich ist. Grandson couldn\\'t even get them on, they are so tightly cut. The laces broke after slightly over one week of use. Horrible quality. Before it broke, my son complained it was very uncomfortable, as the metal grommets on the sides rub against the side of his foot. Nice pair of shoes These shoes are cute and jus fine. I wanted to comment on the company actually. I bought these for a wedding for my son to wear and they werenâ\\x80\\x99t going to arrive in time.  I reached out to Amazon with no luck. I finally contacted the company directly and they said they didnâ\\x80\\x99t think they could get them to me in time because of how the process works. However, I literally received these the very next day. Whoever I spoke to, thank you, you obviously went out of your way to get these pulled and shipped to me and I canâ\\x80\\x99t thank you enough. They made it on time and the wedding was gorgeous!!My son kept the shoes on all night and now wears them when he wants to dress up casual  ..he says they are comfy and shoe laces are long enough he can tie them easily When my 8 year old asked for â\\x80\\x9cskate shoesâ\\x80\\x9d, I could only picture AirWalks or Vans (which are cute, but donâ\\x80\\x99t fit their wide feet well). I began searching and found these. They are not just skate shoes, but also adorable and good, Adidas quality. Great looking shoe at a great price! I got these in the gray with black stripes and the black with white stripes. Looks exactly like the ones I got from the store that were $20 more. They run big. I wear a womenâ\\x80\\x99s 7 in most shoes. I measured my foot on the big kids Adidas size chart and according to it, I should get a 6.5. I got the 6 because they didnâ\\x80\\x99t have any other sizes and based on other reviews from women I was hoping they would work out. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re big. I measured them against the menâ\\x80\\x99s 7 I had from the store and there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t much difference between the 6 and 7. They measured the same as the menâ\\x80\\x99s 6.5 I had from the store. I wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve ordered a 5 if they were available. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to guess with the weird sizing situation. Hopefully putting in some insoles will help because I want to keep them. Very nice shoes. Got them when they were on sale and they are really nice. The shoes fit as expected. I bought these for my seven year old son. He loves how comfortable they are. Definitely worth the buy! Kid loves them. Good fit and comfortable. These shoes fit well and are comfortable.

Ich weiÃ\\x9f nicht warum der Hersteller die Sohle so billig hergestellt hat. Nach ein paar mal anziehen ging die weiÃ\\x9fe Schukappe schon ab. Sollte bei teuren Markenschuhen ein No-Go sein. Komfort und perfekt schucse Ein wunderschÃ¶ner Lederschuh, der allerdings deutlich schmÃ¤ler ausfÃ¤llt. Eigentlich trÃ¤gt unser Sohn die mittlere Breite, hier handelt es sich eher um die schmale AusfÃ¼hrung. Daher ging der Schuh leider retour. Sehr ungewÃ¶hnlich fÃ¼r Superfit Unser Tochter (20 M) zieht diese Schuhe sehr gerne an und lÃ¤uft damit auch gerne herum.Abgesehen davon ist Farbe/Modell sehr schÃ¶n! Beste Schuhe von Superfit generell. Wir sind immer zufrieden und dieser Schuh gefÃ¤llt mir persÃ¶nlich sehr gut Super, hochwertiger Kinderschuh. Meine Tochter fÃ¤hrt voll darauf ab. Muy cÃ³modo para el NiÃ±o Itâ\\x80\\x99s a tight fit! The top part doesnâ\\x80\\x99t open so it made  it super hard for my son to get the shoe on. We ended up returning the shoes! If #Puma will make it so that the top part can open and then possible Velcro closed or maybe zipper it would be awesome so kids can easily slide their feet in!! This product fits well but may not be ideal for a child that has wide feet. The strap across the top has some stretch but it is very thick and does not stretch easily which may make it difficult for a wider foot to get pass that section. The entire shoe is made very well. Difficult to put on. They are too hard. Son loves them and is willing to double up in sock layers to make fit. Would recommend going a half size down. My son is 4.5 big kids by size measurements but could easily have fit for a long while in a 4 My Grandson loves his Puma\\'s and so do I â\\x9d£ï¸\\x8f No complains Muy lindos pero aprietan de la parte de Arriba I order  a size 11 kids size shoes received  and 10 it\\'s very tight on my child foot. elastic  that run across cant expands.  sorry I every purchased  this damn shoes Producto original, de buena calidad. Talla justa, CumpliÃ³ las expectativas. Mein 4- jÃ¤hriger Sohn liebt diese Stiefel und mÃ¶chte seine anderen Schuhe nicht mehr tragen. Er hat in den Stiefeln keine SchweiÃ\\x9ffÃ¼Ã\\x9fe wie in einigen anderen Schuhen. Er lÃ¤uft sehr gut  darin und hat auch bei eisigen Temperaturen keine kalten FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe. Die Stiefel sind meiner Meinung nach von einer sehr guten QualitÃ¤t und deshalb etwas schwerer. Meinen Sohn stÃ¶rt das Ã¼berhaupt nicht. Er kommt perfekt rein und wieder raus (das war bei anderen Stiefeln problematischer). Das Highlight fÃ¼r ihn ist natÃ¼rlich das blinken. Ich werde die Stiefel auch wohl im nÃ¤chsten Winter kaufen. Beck Gummistiefel begleiten uns nun schon einige Jahre. Passform super, vorallem, wenn die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe etwas breiter geschnitten sind. Klare Kaufempfehlung. Die Leuchtfunktion beim Gehen ein Highlight fÃ¼r die Kleinen. Schuhe halten die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe im Herbst und Winter schÃ¶n warm. Wir haben dieses Modell schon das zweite Jahr im Einsatz. Habe die Gummistiefel fÃ¼r meine beiden Kinder gekauft. Und sie wurden ausgiebig im Urlaub, am Strand und in PfÃ¼tzen, getestet. Die Gummistiefel haben den Test bestanden und bekommen 5 Sterne.â\\x98\\x85 entsprechen der angegebene GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe, genug Platz auch mit dicken Sockenâ\\x98\\x85 Wasserdichtâ\\x98\\x85 halten kleine FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe warm und trockenâ\\x98\\x85 schÃ¶nes Designâ\\x98\\x85 blinkende Sohle, sehr gut sichtbar im dunkelnKann diese Stiefel nur empfehlen ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Ich habe diese Gummistiefel nun das zweite Mal bestellt, aus den ersten ist mein SÃ¶hnchen herausgewachsen. Die Gummistiefel sind sehr robust: Sie haben ein ganzes Kindergartenjahr vergleichsweise gut Ã¼berstanden! Sie halten warm und trocken. Es stimmt, dass die Stiefel etwas schwerer sind als andere Gummistiefel, aber meinen Sohn hat das nicht gestÃ¶rt oder beim Laufen behindert. Ein paar kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Blinkfunktion hat im Laufe des Jahres den Geist aufgegeben... auch riechen die Stiefel leicht nach Chemie, wenn sie noch ganz neu sind. Die Gummistiefel sind sehr schÃ¶n verarbeitet und unser Sohn liebt sie. Nebst der guten Verarbeitung ist der Leuchteffekt sehr ansprechend und unser Sohn ist gut zu sehen. Der Leuchteffekt bleibt auch bei starker Verschmutzung bestehen und die Schuhe lassen sich sehr gut reinigen. Mein Sohn ist sehr zufrieden. Die Stiefel sind gut verarbeitet und halten im Winter die FÃ¼sse schÃ¶n trocken und warm. Sie sind von innen vollstÃ¤ndig mit einem kuscheligen Kunstfell gefÃ¼ttert und von auÃ\\x9fen im ganzen mit durchsichtigem Gummi Ã¼berzogen. Das Dinosaurierskelettmuster ist schÃ¶n und perfekt fÃ¼r alle Dinofans. Die Ferse blinkt beim gehen, was im dunklen Winter nur vom Vorteil sein kann. Der Stiefel fÃ¤llt etwas groÃ\\x9f aus. Sollte vielleicht lieber eine GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe kleiner bestellt werden. Alles im ganzen ein guter Wintergummistiefel zum relativ gÃ¼nstigen Preis. Sohnemann brauchte neue Gummistiefel und diese fand er optisch sehr schÃ¶n, also bestellt.Leider passten die ersten nicht, weshalb wir sie dann nochmal grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt haben.Er ist jetzt sehr zufrieden, sie blinken, halten trockenbund sind innen auch noch etwas flauschig und daher etwas wÃ¤rmer als andere Stiefel. Resistentes, no entra agua los dÃ\\xadas de lluvia y con un diseÃ±o informal que tanto sirve para llevar con uniforme al colegio o para unos vaqueros en fin de semana. Perfectos Die Stiefel sehen schÃ¶n aus und die Blinklichter funktionieren einwandfrei. Allerdings sind die Stiefel schon ziemlich schwer und scheinen von der Passform nicht besonders gut zu sein. Mein Sohn hat es nach zwei Versuchen sein lassen, da er keinen guten halt hatte und somit nicht bequem damit laufen konnte. Very nice boots. I had hoped the shoe laces would be flexible and integrated like most Camper shoes. Here you get regular laces, and as such, you don\\'t get the Camper \\'feeling\\' or practicality of putting them on and off quickly. They are quite light, which is a plus. die Lieferung kam sehr schnell und gut verpackt bei mir an.die Schuhe sind wie in den Angaben beschrieben.mein Kind hat sich sehr gefreut.ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Preis und der QualitÃ¤t. Suuuuper bequeme Schuhe, mein Mann sagt, er lÃ¤uft wie auf Wolken!Passen perfekt! GÃ¼zel bir yagmur Ã§izmesi ama paket geldiginde actim ve hasarli oldugunu gÃ¶rdÃ¼m..

But it would be better to have longer shoe laces love my running shoes!! These were waaaay smaller than the size they were supposed to be.Cute shoes tho.i bought them for my 6 yr old ,but they fit my 4 yr old.so,if you order them,get them 2 sizes bigger than you usually would get. My daughter was size 7 I ordered a size 9 they were still very tight. I\\'d say size up 10 they would fit perfectly. They super cute otherwise 4 stars for sizing issue. Not true to size at all. They run very small. But after return and requesting 3 sizes bigger, we are pleased. The shoes are cute in person than in pic. Honestly look way better in person does not look super cheap in the bowl detail is very decent real cute but ran small, loved the look but had to return To small for my granddaughter Runs smaller than the actual size. Very cute but they run small. Returned it. Ordered a size 6. Looked like size 3. Was very small. Not very good quality. They were extremely small not true to her size at all. Pretty but no good if it donâ\\x80\\x99t fit. So comfortable. Soft white leather. True to size, authentic product. Amazing value, super soft leather and incredibly comfortable and lightweight! Very poor leather quality. The sneakers are very cute and elegant but have been sitting in my closet for the past months. I donâ\\x80\\x99t see myself wearing them again. I wore them for a couple of weeks and they got soiled, as all shoes do. When I tried to clean them with a damp cloth, which I always do with my soiled leather shoes, I got a discoloration as a result that was even bigger than the initial spot, and nothing can be done about it. It cannot be fixed. Unfortunately, a waste of money. Not leather, inside or out. Really smelly polyurethane smell, too. Got them for $23.00, so I\\'m keeping them. No wonder one of the reviewers stated that they didn\\'t last. This shoe is a bit too tight and the leather shoelaces shed little pieces of leather! They did include a second pair of cotton laces, which is odd. Super cute shoes. The leather laces are just ridiculous because they shed everywhere, but they send regular laces to change them out. need to put in an insole that supports a foot I don\\'t like wearing flat shoes so I put my own in. The top of the shoe rubbed really bad on my right foot large toe joint which is my \"good\" foot. My left foot with having had major surgeries didn\\'t have same issue. So I am still healing from 2 bad blisters on the right toe joint a week ago. Great quality leather, narrow fit but length is true to size. They\\'re in new condition but came in tissue in an amazon box, no frye box. the laces seem really long and thick for the shoes but overall they\\'re super cute and a great way to dress up sneakers! I bought these shoes despite the price tag of 140$ because they were exactly my style and when I got them I indeed loved the look, however, the first day I wore the shoes (only for 2 hours) I got a blister the size of a quarter (that have caused me to loose sleep for two days do to pain). If shoes are that pricy there is no reason why they shouldn\\'t be built with comfort or at the very least not cause this amount of pain :( Great fit, but the sole is totally flat and hard, offering very little traction. Odd being able to accidentally slide while wearing a tennis shoe. Thick suede laces are not easy to use. Sehr schÃ¶ner Schuh zum gÃ¼nstigen Preis Diese Gummistiefel sind im Vergleich zu vielen anderen alternativ bestellten sehr bequem, nicht so eng geschnitten am FuÃ\\x9f, sie haben eine biegsame Sohle und sind vorallem geruchsarm.Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen! Die Stiefel sind von ganz guter QualitÃ¤t, sehen hÃ¼bsch aus und sind wohl lt. meiner Tochter auch bequem Meine Tochter zieht sie gerne an. Sie fallen allerdings etwas kleiner aus. Ã\\x9cberrascht, sind sÃ¼Ã\\x9fe weiche Gummistiefel! QualitÃ¤t ist gut und wie erwartetGerne empfehle ich weiter:-) Meine Tochter liebt diese Gummistiefel. Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis stimmt Preis - Leistung in Ordnung. Bardzo Å\\x82adne i wygodne Super Passform Great shoes for kids. The pink is actually nicer in real life than photos. I bought these  June 15. The shoes are either defective or counterfeit, itâ\\x80\\x99s now July 21. The return window closed 7 days agoand unfortunately these tennis shoes created a hole where my toe is. I wore them approximately one hour per day and not every day throughout the month. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve bought new balance, even this same style,  for years and never had this happen within the first month. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re either defective in which case Iâ\\x80\\x99d like the manufacturer or seller to return them and replace with a new pair or theyâ\\x80\\x99re counterfeit and not made well. Iâ\\x80\\x99m hoping Amazon or the seller will get in touch with me so we can rectify the situation. Thank you My son is flat-footed with an overpronation problem. These shoes have helped stabilize that. Plus, he is really rough on shoes, but these hold up ok. By the time he grows out of them, they are pretty demolished, but they last long enough for us. These shoes wore out quickly. Fewer than 3 months and they have a big hole and the soles are separating from the shoe. We bought New Balance from the local NB store and they lasted 7 months. These were disappointing. my kid has very wide feet so sizing is always difficult but these fit true to size in XW. I ordered 4 pairs NB (all in different models in xw) and by far he says these have the best cushioning and support. only wish they had more colors. I bought these for my 9yo in a size 7. I came on here and saw a great deal! I got these for $18! It had to be a mistake. My daughter loves them and says she never wants to take them off they are so comfortable. Mom, it feels like Iâ\\x80\\x99m walking on clouds! Just under (2)two months and both left and right soles have split apart! Will never purchase these models of NB. Never had any other issues with the other models. Buy at your own risk and NOT recommend these shoes for the kiddos. I purchased these for my daughter in June.  By the time school started in August they had holes in them.  Keep in mind my daughter was wearing flip flops most of the summer, not tennis shoes. These were not worth the money for less than two months of wear. I bought a pair for daily walking and running (5.5 in big kid as I\\'m a size 7 in women).  I\\'ve yet to experience any pain in my feet. I needed a pair of shoes to support my flat feet and the these definitely do the job. The arches are wonderful on my feet and the shoes are light. They\\'re breathable and super bright! I\\'ve gotten many compliments. I plan on purchasing another pair before they run out! Good looking shoe. The previous pair we had of this same shoe lasted for almost a year on a boy who is really rough on shoes. Runs a little large. Great for kids who tend to walk on the insides of their feet. Nice color combination. Very comfortable and perfect fit. I bought this colour because it was half the price of the other colour options and I wanted the shoe for outside work so colour was of less concern. I like the colour and am wearing these shoes much more than I expected to. Excellent value. I\\'m wearing them now.  There\\'re very light BUT very strong!  I\\'m not quite sure about this, but I\\'m pretty sure that on a wet floor, they\\'re more stable when I put weight on them.  I simply don\\'t want to know WITHOUT A DOUBT, because I don\\'t want to get my insurance involved. ;] Excellent Very comfortable and the color is accurate Love it I have nothing bad to say about it. Confy, expectrd size nice color These super cute, casual sneaker that are pretty comfy. I personally would prefer a bit more arch support, but they are still comfy for casual wear.  They look cute with shorts, jean, and casual dresses.  I love the little gold details, like eyelets and on the end of the shoe strings. These are easily the worst shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever owned. I love the print, but they are so uncomfortable. There is padding in the bottom and the back of the shoe, but the back of the shoe pinches my heel. I did buy gel inserts to put in the back of the shoe, and they donâ\\x80\\x99t help. I was hoping that the problem would get better once they were broken in, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve worn them almost daily for 2 weeks and itâ\\x80\\x99s not. I will not be buying another pair of Keds. These are so cute but I had to return them as they were way too stiff and would have caused blisters on my heels for sure. I had red marks just from trying them on. Super bummed because they are so cute. I love these shoes. They are so comfortable! Very cute!! Beautiful and comfortable pair of shoes! I absolutely am obsessed with these!! Very cute but horribly uncomfortable and strange sizing. Narrow in toe area but long and stiff, rubs heel. Returning. I love Keds, they are one of my favorites shoes. I especially luv the cheetah print, that is also my favorite. Perfect Fit ! Look Great! So Comfortable! Sind soweit zufrieden.Schuh ist einfach schick mit den BlÃ¼mchen darauf und die Farben sowieso.Verarbeitung ist immer soweit in Ordnung, ist auch nicht unser erster Schuh dieser Marke.Punkt Abzug gibt es nur fÃ¼r die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe, da wir etwas wollten das bissel lÃ¤nger hÃ¤lt und eigentlich ne Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer genommen hatten, nur ist er schon bald wieder zu klein.Aber alles in allem kaufen wir gerne diese Schuhe, preiswert und gut. Acquistate in offerta a â\\x82¬10,50 il prodotto ha un ottimo rapporto qualitÃ\\xa0/prezzo, sono ben rifinite, calzano bene, sono anatomiche e la bambina le trova comode. Le ho trovate migliori di altre marche piÃ¹ blasonate che di solito \"appiattiscono\" l\\'arco plantare, queste, invece, lo seguono molto bene. Ich habe erneut Schuhe dieser Marke fÃ¼r meine Tochter fÃ¼r den Sportunterricht bestellt. Ihr gefallen sie sehr und sie sind sehr bequem. Eigentlich hat meine Tochter grad 30/31. Die letzten Schuh waren in 31 aber sind ihr jetzt zu klein. Habe die 32 u 33 bestellt... Man kann die Innensohle rausnehmen und da sieht man das die 33 genau richtig ist...Fazit: Lico immer 2 Nummern grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellen solange das Kind noch wÃ¤chst ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 Unsere Kinder tragen seit Jahren Sportschuhe von Lico und das Preis-Leistungs-VerhÃ¤ltnis hat uns immer Ã¼berzeugt! Bei dem letzten Paar LÃ¶st sich leider nach kurzer Tragezeit die FuÃ\\x9fsohle und ist nun zur stolperfalle geworden...:-( Mit groÃ\\x9fen Augen hat meine Tochter (6) diese Schuhe bestaunt und gleich getragen. Passen perfekt und sind bequem. Und vor allem sehen sie super aus ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8d Very pretty in appearance but the soles come loose after just 2 months. I do not recommend this. Wenn ihr sie bestellt empfehle ich 1-2 Nummern kleiner Muy buena, mi hija de 4 aÃ±os las usa para la gimnasia del cole y despuÃ©s de un aÃ±o de trote, aÃºn estÃ¡n perfectas. Me ha gustado Ã©sta marca, repetirÃ©! Die Schuhe sind sehr schick. En un par de meses las puntas de las zapatillas ya estaban despegadas y en unos meses mÃ¡s tienen un aspecto lamentable These are great minus the fact the tongue is sewn to the insides of the shoe...maybe that is a thing they do to cleats but my first experience and makes a little difficult to get on but upside doesnâ\\x80\\x99t come off easy either when untied. So otherwise 5star would have been given! The opening for the shoe is fixed. It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t stretch and the opening is small. So unless you have an extremely petit ankle and foot area then these are nearly impossible to put on.  My 9 year old who is petite couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even get these on after trying a second pair a size larger.  Disheartening considering Adidas cleats are our normal go-to. Daughter loved them. Fit was great and they look great too! Daughter is 12. Shoes fit perfect. You have to break them in though. Overall, great fit and great look. No more blisters I wear a size 9 1/2 fits perfect! Too small. I want to return them for a pair that fit comfortably. Have two bloody blisters now. My wife recently used these every day on our cruise and found them to be excellent for dancing.  They are pretty good looking, too. First pair I ordered was too large but these fit perfectly. I normally take a 11 1/2 but a 11 was too large. 10 fits nicely. They are very nice sandals at a very reasonable price.  Very fast shipping. I ordered them just before noon on Thursday and they arrived Friday.  WoW. After I tried them on, I then bought a different type, because the insole has a ridge on one side that feels uncomfortable.(The different ones I bought next â\\x80\\x94 DenverHayes Quad Comfort â\\x80\\x94 feel amazing!) Yes, my husband was thrilled with his new Sandals! They fit very good and he was happy with the colour choice! Fue un regalo para mi papÃ¡ y le quedaron muy bien. CÃ³modas y frescas Los pedÃ\\xad para mi novio, Ã©l es #7 en MÃ©xico y los que pedÃ\\xad de acuerdo a la conversiÃ³n le quedaron un poco grandes pero nada grave. Me dice que son muy cÃ³modos y se nota desde el material de la plantilla. Son bonitos y los comprÃ© a muy buen precio durante el hot sale. Perfect. Exact size. Very comfortable. Would buy again. As ordered. Wish someone would make them out of leather. Would have given 5 stars if had leather uppers. The quality is not good A bit bigger.The foam will sunk in and your feet will feel the bottom.Due to a bit oversize when walking, the area near the toe cap is rubbing my toes. El producto es de una excelente calidad, es muy amblio y recuerden que si lo usan sin calcetin, recomiendo pedir una talla mas chica. Purchased for myself but found too narrow for my feet. Gifted to my daughter whose feet are skinnier.

Tragen die Sohle ab. QualitÃ¤t mangelhaft. SUPER COMODOS, QUEDAN COMO UN GUANTE, LA TALLA EXACTA, ME ENCANTARON. I read many reviews before I bought these. Since so many people said they run big and my last pair of adidas cloudfoam were pretty big, I went half a size down. I usually wear 8.5 so I ordered an 8. They were a little tight the first couple times I wore them so I would advise just ordering them in your regular size. Luckily they\\'ve stretched out a bit so my foot fits in there perfectly now. I just have to wear thin socks. The shoes are super light weight. I\\'ve used them for the gym and for running errands. Only thing I don\\'t like is that the bottom of the shoe is too smooth. I\\'d be scared to wear these on a rainy day. Al mes se daÃ±oNo es buena calidad Nice tough shoe for my play hard grandson to wear with his school uniform. Heâ\\x80\\x99s hard on shoes and these are holding up nicely. Great shoes for school Tolles FuÃ\\x9fbett Sehr schnelle Lieferung gute Verpackung des gewÃ¼nschten Artikels.Gerne wieder Super bequemer Schuh, schÃ¶ne farbe I own this shoe in denim, burgundy, pink, mint green and now red. Love them all Shoe was started to tear ( see above) just in 5 outings on the court.This needs to be replaced Nice shoes and good bottom support but way way too narrow and pinches my toes. I have small narrow childlike feet and these are still way too narrow! Not accurate sizing. These shoes are very nice and quite comfortable. I usually wear a 10 but these fit small so I had to reorder in 10.5. Love skechers slip on shoes! Holes have worn in the toe area within months of moderate indoor use. Very poor quality. I was happy with these shoes until this happened. See image. I\\'ll NEVER buy Skechers again. Love these shoes. Lightweight and very comfortable.  Not good for a wide foot. Otherwise true to size. Perfect fitting...Very Light Weight and Comfortable...

It is surely a defective product. Window return closed so couldnt exchange. What a waste.!! They seem a bit odd fitting compared to other sketchers but ok. Getting use to them.  The back is a bit low La consueta sicurezza nell\\'acquistare scarpe Ecco. Comode e confortevoli. Loved the shoe - super comfortable. Only problem was the color - kid of a taupe-y grey.  Just a little off for my clothing colors.  Would have been great if it was a true dark charcoal grey - otherwise, straight black always works, but sadly, that was not a color option. Way to narrow, plus the upper was not flexible. No era lo q esperaba. Me base en la tabla que tienen para las tallas y me quedo demasiado grande. La parte de enfrente estaba demasiado ancha tambiÃ©n. Y el color no era como el de la foto. Dos veces pedÃ\\xad este modelo, en uno me cancelaron el pedido y el reembolso fue rÃ¡pido. La segunda vez me mandaron el nÃºmero equivocado, se le quedaron a un familiar,  el modelo le gustÃ³ y la comodidad, recomiendo que pidan medio nÃºmero menos del que calzan vienen amplios. La calidad de los tenis es muy buena y a ese precio excelente! En lo particular me encanta el color, los uso para correr y son muy ligeros y cÃ³modos. Los devolvi, el precio era atractivo pero no me gustaron los acabados y la forma, parecia tamal. Los colores no eran feos pero no eran de una calidad destacable. no pagaria mas de 500 pesos por ellos. POR CONSEJO DE UNA  AMIGA PEDÃ\\x8d TENIS DE ESTA MARCA.

TUVE QUE DEVOLVERLOS Somehow I think the shoes look wider on the pictures, colours are very true to the pictures, shoe soles are not as thick as I have imagined. But for the sales price I got I cannot really complain much. Los tenis estÃ¡n suuuper bien, un producto de calidad, sin embargo los devolvÃ\\xad derivado a quÃ© a la persona le quedaron demasiado grandes a pesar de ser su talla, es decir, vienen mÃ¡s grandes, MODO WIDE, para personas con pie ancho, OJO: si los vas a comprar ten en cuenta que vienen mÃ¡s grandes que la talla que compras.

Me encanta New Balance porque nunca he tenido que \"moldear los zapatos/tenis\" desde la primera ve se sienten muy agusto. Fueron los primero new balance de mi hija, me arrepentÃ\\xad de no haber comprado para mÃ\\xad ya que estaban con descuento, el calzado es cÃ³modo, ligero y su estÃ©tica esta del cien..... VolverÃ\\xada comprarlo Me gustÃ³ el precio, estaba excelente, se sientes ligeros y muy cÃ³modos, la parte del frente parece gamuza, pero no lo es, es un material sintÃ©tico. New shoes specifically bought for thin soles used for drumming. Very comfortable. I always enjoy all of my Adidas shoes. Will only be used for drumming. Look great, more importantly appropriately thin-soled for drumming. Would recommend. Very very good weat 11 usually and for these shoes have 10.5 and next time i think ill go with 10. i\\'d say orear .5 smaller then your adidas shoes or 1 smaller then any other brand shoe. shoes are confy tho and seem durable Awesome !! Great shoe for the gym and skipping. I ordered half size bigger like recommended an they work perfect.  I wouldn\\'t run in them but they are nice and flat and work great for squats and deadlift. Good value for the money Quality looks good however It was small in size. Return to vendor. Great fit and feel would recommend this shoes It is a really good pair of wrestling boots! I would recommend these for starters! Great shoe but a bit narrow Good shoes Brought as a work boot but I did not like the height of the heel so returning for refund Good boot, just a little larger than expected as I ordered a little big thinking that actual size would be too small.... returned for a little smaller size. Thank ya kindly sir This is my 2nd pair , love them , love them , love them. Be Blessed I\\'ve been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn\\'t feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can\\'t take the chance of wearing low quality footwear. Sorry Dan post, I gotta move on. I bought these with apprehension having Spine issues and a Spinal Implant Device for Pain. I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought Iâ\\x80\\x99d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot, Justin has Issues now for some reason. I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever put on my Feet, I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot, thatâ\\x80\\x99s unheard of and if youâ\\x80\\x99re a Boot Person you know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m talking about, some discomfort is expected with new Boots. I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 1/2 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed. Iâ\\x80\\x99m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and Iâ\\x80\\x99m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot, I canâ\\x80\\x99t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion. I did have to put in an Insole due to my Right Boot missing one but it didnâ\\x80\\x99t matter, these are just a quality Comfortable Boot.Semper Fidelis These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women\\'s 8.5 and the men\\'s size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper \\'brushed or suede\\' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an \"oily brown\" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this \\'nappy brushed leather or suede\\' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer. I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I\\'m just going to get my money back.  Too bad. I\\'ve owned over 10 pairs of Dan Post boots. Yes, I\\'m a big fan of them. I enjoy wearing Western-styled clothes and boots. I\\'m also a truck driver, and a biker. These boots fit the bill for all of these. Right out of the box, they look great, and are very comfortable. I wear a 12D. I ordered a 12D, and the fit is spot on. No problems at the heel, arch, or toe. They\\'re listed as Waterproof. Haven\\'t put that to the test yet. They\\'re not as heavy as I thought they\\'d be. Very nice boot, easy to get used to, and looks great. I gave them a good treatment of Leather Honey, to condition the leather, and give them some extra protection. All in all, a great boot. I have no issues with them. They\\'re Dan Post boots---great boots, great quality, and great looks. As I titled this review, if you\\'re considering these boots, buy them. A great all around boot. Lastly, I\\'ve read reviews, mentioning that they\\'re made in China. Yes, unfortunately, mine say it, too. Really sad. I\\'ve owned these boots for two years and have worn them nearly every day.  From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I\\'ve asked and more.  In fact they\\'re still going and I can\\'t stand not wear them because they\\'re incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather.  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apart.I\\'ve given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for me.The only time I don\\'t wear these boots is when I\\'m working-out or I\\'m hiking.  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the field.Pros:The fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon: The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out. That\\'s the only weak point and I think it\\'s the piping that causes the failure. Muy bonitos. Le gustaron mucho a mi hija. Vienen mÃ¡s grandes pero siempre compro una talla menos en esta marca. Los recomiendo The shoes themselves are super cute but the box came trashed! I wouldn\\'t say it was beat up during transit either. I was disappointed because they are a gift. Cute shoes but started to stink with her not wearing socks after only a few wears. Very disappointed. leider viel zu groÃ\\x9f, ging zurÃ¼ck, kulante RÃ¼ckname, gute Abwicklung Ich trage Rolling Soft Schuhe von Gabor gerne und bin bis jetzt noch nie enttÃ¤uscht worden. Schuhe passen wie erwartet ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Passen perfekt Me ha gustado la rapidez de la entrega. They look great on her feet. Really nice shoe. And has withstood the whole summer without looking so beat up. Lol These shoes fit my daughter as hoped, and they are SUPER cute. However, the zippers on the back are unbelievably hard to zip and unzip. I would much rather have bought her shoes that she can put on and take off without needing assistance. These sandals are adorable!! They fit just as expected. Probably not the best shoe for wider feet though as theyâ\\x80\\x99re pretty skinny, but work just fine for my step daughter. The back is a little hard to zip up and down but Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure itâ\\x80\\x99ll be easier in time. Definitely would buy again. I bought these for my 4 year old. She absolutely loves them. She wears them every chance she gets and they dont show a lot of \"wear and tear.\" They look great with shorts or a skirt/dress. So fashionable. Well crafted. My goodness do we struggle to zip these things up!They are much wider than anticipated.Meh Cutest shoes ever! Exactly as described but cuter in person. They fit according to size! Came in a box from Kmart which was really nice, super cute, and well packaged. Has not tried them on yet but will love them! Lovely slipper..I accidentally ordered wrong size..I\\'m too far to return. Great buy These shoes were packaged like they cost $100. Cans in a lovely reusable bag, a bracelet and a thank you card. Very nice. Highly recommended. Thought I would love these. I didn\\'t open them right away, so I did a few days ago only to find that they fit about half a size big, and they feel like they\\'re a wide width. Then I notice that the eyelets on the left shoe don\\'t line up so when I tied it up it made it feel weird. I don\\'t usually complain but the price of these was too much for what I received. Excuse my fat ankles in the pictureð\\x9f\\x98\\x81ð\\x9f\\x98¬ But these are so very comfortable! And they are very lightweight too...not real heavy like some shoes are. I\\'ve been looking pretty much everywhere for a comfortable pair of shoes to do some walking in and these are just right. They\\'re also easy to slip on without having to use your fingers to help with getting them on. I love them and may get another pair in a different color! ð\\x9f\\x8e¨ The shoe is stylish and comfortable. Please do not listen to previous review on sizing up.  I did and regret it. I wear size 8 ordered 8 1/2 and now a little too big.  Order your right size and you will be happy with this product. The shoe is a bit narrower than I expected. They have good heel comfort but no arch support. Love it comfortable and light weight buy them for work They look great and feel good! Muy cÃ³modos y los nÃºmeros son exactos Comfortable. Size was correct Muy cÃ³modo me gustan Ho acquistato queste scarpe perchÃ© catturato dal design moderno e accattivante.I materiali costruttivi sembrano abbastanza buoni, il mix tra pelle e tessuto stile camouflage sulla parte posteriore rende particolare la scarpa.Sono provviste di una zip laterale che permette di indossarle facilmente, la vestibilitÃ\\xa0 Ã¨ conforme alla solita taglia che indosso per altri modelli di scarpe e sono comode da calzare. Sieht gut aus, hÃ¤lt ohne Innenfutter auch warm genug und passt sehr gut.Material auch wie beschrieben.WÃ¼rde fast behaupten er wÃ¤re eine Nummer zu groÃ\\x9f bzw. passt meine normale GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe sehr bequem. Bei Sneakern nehme ich sonst immer eine Nr. grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer, hier aber nicht erforderlich. Verarbeitung und QualitÃ¤t top. Modern und passen genau. Bonitos y cÃ³modos porque estÃ¡n anchos pero se despegaron muy pronto. TenÃ\\xada mejores expectativas de esta marca y en esta ocasiÃ³n no duraron. Bonito a la vista, pero de muy mala calidad, se despegaron al mes de uso, ambos tenis de toda la parte delantera, parecÃ\\xada una buena oferta, pero salÃ\\xad perdiendo Fue un regalo para una prima muy bonito a la vista por los colores esos colores morados le gustaron mucho y son comodos  me comenta. Muy bonitos lastima que llegaron sÃºper grandes en realidad no son 23 cm EstÃ¡n precioosos, aunque son tenis idealmente para niÃ±os, se los regale a mi hermana de 34 aÃ±os y le quedaron a la perfecciÃ³n.  Estoy muy contento con la compra. me gustan los tens para mi hij, gracias Bonitos. De muy buena calidad. Hermosos en verdad Bien. NÃºmero exacto Me gustÃ³ bien sellado original They sent the wrong size, product description was misleading Buenos, un poco pequeÃ±os Like the shoes...received within 2 days... I have worn New Balance shoes for 10+ years now.  I started with New Balance WX1011 and WX1012 Cross trainers for tennis based on recommendation from my local New Balance specialty shop.  WX 1011 and 1012 were light weight mesh, flexible with good lateral support and soles that were not too stiff.  As a replacement shoe, New Balance recommended this 966v3 shoe. This is one of the most uncomfortable shoes I have tried on.  It is stiff, it presses across the toes and causes pain and the soles are too thick and stiff for quick movement on the tennis court. Comfortable fit except for the area at the top lace hole. It is very stiff and rests on the inner ankle bone which causes rubbing and discomfort. Tried tieing at a lower hole but still rubs. Once I figure out how to alleviate this problem I will be happy. Hope in time, it will loosen up. As mentioned by others, these shoes not only run small but they pinch in the forefoot. Also, the \"fit and finish\" of these shoes is highly disappointing -  the way the tongue is sewn into the shoe leaves a lot to be desired and the extra fabric inside the shoe rubs your feet. Finally, the plastic edge where the lace holes sit is extremely rigid and this same plastic edge also affects the front of your foot when tied.Am definitely returning and looking for a better solution. These are very uncomfortable sneakers.  I bought them a while  ago and thought they just needed more time to break in.  Months later, still feel stiff, heavy, and has some plastic pieces that dig in some spots.  Will have to get rid of these. I loved the colors but sizing runs small. I wear a size 11 normally and was trying to find a wider pair of shoes. These are very tight on my foot and Iâ\\x80\\x99m hoping they stretch out a bit when worn in. When I ordered these, the website said 6.5 Medium but at checkout it said 6.5 D. I called Amazon & they said these were 6.5 Medium. They arrived & the box said 6.5 D. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s too wide for me so I returned them. I have other New Balance tennis shoes that are 6.5B. Iâ\\x80\\x99m grateful shipping & return were free. Nice looking shoe. Still battle with fit. Also the black is glittering which looks strange. NO arch support it is not original product, Replica of New Balance shoe..I really wonder and so very about India, why this much cheating and corruption happening India.I can see some places of shoe no stitches. Some place of shoe not sticked with glue very very very pooor product. New balance is a recognized brand for sports shoes, this particular shoe is branded as running shoes. I had purchased this shoe in 18 Dec 2020 & I am not able to use it anymore, due to the damage to the heel area. Within 2 months of use the area near my toe got damaged & I had to get leather patch glued to it (from inside) to prevent further damage (clearly visible on both shoes).Within 4 months heel support area got worn out (refer picture) causing pain in heel.For the price, this shoe should have lasted 2 years, but it did not last 4 months.I run / walk average of 5 to 8 km daily, normally my shoes last over 5 years, but I was expecting this shoe to last at least 2 years. The got this shoe for just 1100 however the quality was not very good and fitting was also very tight. The inside sole and upper of shoe doesn\\'t feel to be of high quality and looks like it won\\'t last longer than 3-4 months. After seeing the shoe i returned it and would not recommend you to buy this particular shoe from New Balance. You get what u pay for. Decent for the price. Very basic shoe. If you want a neutral shoe which u can use for commute as sneaker and use it for ocassional short distance run then it might suit u. Cushioning is provided by fresh foam which is decent but not as plush. Not much of a tech goes into it. Like it doesn\\'t have hard plate in mid sole which keeps ur midfoot stable or say solid heel lock is missing. No extra layers of protection, in terms of cushioning in the sole. Laces are just basic. Build quality is ok but not great. Not suitable for broad feet. Decent but I think Asics Gel Nimbus and Mizuno Waverider are miles ahead of it in terms of neutral road running shoe. Waverider 19 is still the most value for money product here in India. Gel Nimbus are bit expensive. If u still wanna stuck with NB better look for Fresh Foam 1080 V or 880 V. Fitting is perfect (i have ordered one size up). Light weight but the sole and quality of the product is good. Thanks amazon for the surprising offer, i am glad that i got this pair at a comparatively low price for this quality product.best for walking and running, it looks very stylish, we can use them as the casual wear too. After all it is NB it would fit for any duty.. Initially..I was fooled by description that product need to be bought one size larger...But eventually 9 UK is 9.5 US so..Buy ur own size..Ran 5 km with it on first day..Comfortable..1000 skipping in one go..Comfortable..Only one test left..HOW LONG IT LAST..??Good product. estan hermosos y la gamusa es muy suave y se ven increibles, muy muy comodos y color y precio excelente. lo malo es que con el paso del tiempo se ensucian mucho, hay que tener cuidado con este tipo de tenis Vender un zapato tamaÃ±o wide sin aclararlo me parece un engaÃ±o. Era para deshacerse de sus saldos? MÃ\\xadnimo ofrezcan un precio acorde en todo caso.El tenis serÃ\\xada excelente si su tamaÃ±o fuese normal. Got these in 12, 4E as I have large feet. Usually, new balance fits me properly in 6E, but I thought I would give these a try to see. Man, these are made SMALL. Another pair of New Balance which I bought at the same time fit decently, these would not even get on my foot. Padrisimos y muy cÃ³modoPara correr, soy mÃ¡s rÃ¡pidoCon estos tenis, los siento muy ligeros y en carreras de 5 a 10 km me funcionan muy bien Sehr schÃ¶ner brauner Sneaker. Passt sehr gut und sieht nicht zu groÃ\\x9f aus. Kann den Schuh nur weiter empfehlen, sieht sogar in echt besser aus die Farbe als auf jedem Foto. WÃ¼rde ich wieder kaufen. Preis-Leistungs-VerhÃ¤ltnis ist TOP!!! Ganz schick,weich und bequem. Easy anzuziehen durch den seitlichen ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss. Guter Preis. nan Son unos tenis muy bonitos tuve que compramos de nuevo en una tienda por quÃ© no me llegaron los que yo pedÃ\\xad y tuve que devolverlos y decidÃ\\xad buscarlos en una tienda Adidas y al probÃ¡rmelos me di cuanta que estaban muy duros no sentÃ\\xad al boots como le mencionan que son muy cÃ³modos en verdad pagar mÃ¡s de 2,000 pesos por unos tenis con poco confort no vale la pena solo te venden la vista de unos tenis pero no los recomiendo Muy cÃ³modos. Excelente compra. De lo mejor que he tenido adidasA considerar que siendo de tela se ensucian muy rapido y no es fÃ¡cil limpiarlos Great solid shoe. Tight around the heel/Achilles initially, but gets better after some wear. I have a very high arch and the shoes take the pressure and pain away when I play tennis. This is my second pair in two years and I love them They were way too thin on my feet Maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s just this color way but the fit is TERRIBLE. Itâ\\x80\\x99s tight mid-foot because of some band on the top but itâ\\x80\\x99s actually loose in the toe box. When shoes fit this bad, I just can not recommend them for anything. Not for basketball, not for working out, not even for walking. Adidas is a great brand but they made a mistake with these shoes. I can only see them working if you have overly narrow feet and you size down them. First, these are good looking shoes, they fit pretty well, and the sole has pretty good grip.  What is extremely disappointing is the cushioning level.  What you see on the side of the shoe is not at all what is actually in the sole cushion.  I was looking forward to the Boost cushioning.  Instead, what you get appears to be less than a 1/4 inch of cushioning.  After playing a few games on a hard court, my knees were extremely sore.  All the cushioning you see around the heel is window dressing.  I would not recommend to anyone who values their joints. These shoes are awesome and are my new favorites. The Adidas \"boost\" on these are the best cushion I\\'ve ever felt to date. They feel really good when walking or running because you can feel the energy returned to your feet from the boost cushion. I want these shoes in a couple of different color-ways and the 3/4 or high top versions. I like the various different textiles/textures. The thick collar around the ankle & achilles looks kinda weird, but I\\'m used to it & like it now. Kudos to the design team, I would love to see how this shoe was made & put together. ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8dð\\x9f\\x8f¾ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8dð\\x9f\\x8f¾ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8eâ\\x9c\\x8cð\\x9f\\x8f¿ I have worn a 10 D my whole life. These shoes were so narrow I could not get my feet in them. Unless you have a narrow foot I would advise against them gots no soul...grip too slick on indoor courts after only 4-5 wears.  The cushioning is pretty decent but shoes are worthless due to the slickness.  Adidas support was no help other than to suggest giving to a friend. I\\'m offering it to my enemies instead.  Going back to Nike.

Excelente calidad, son muy comodos el unico punto que pudiece decir en contra es la medida es ligeramente mas justa, yo calso del 29 cm y estos tenis son lieramente mas ajustados, pero creo que es el estandar que usa la marca, tengo otros puma de la misma medida(otro modelo) que compre en  liverpool y el mismo detalle observe. Tal vez conviene pedor medio numero mas para personas con los pies mas gorditos. Perfectly as expected & resquested. AsÃ©. Son chingones los zapatos Me encantaron, llegaron un poco tarde pero llegar, amplios y con suela blandita Los zapatos de peor calidad que he tenido en mi vida.

Los materiales, la comodidad, en fin, costo beneficio sobrepasa las espectativas. Sin problema listo para comprar otra variante.

Muy bonitos,  son muuuuyyyy comodos, son geniales. El color en vivo es maravilloso, la comodidad es muy buena. Me quedaron a la medida. Quedan muy chulos. Son de cuero y tela.

Encantada con la compra Etwas grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer als erwartet, behalte sie dennoch fÃ¼r demnÃ¤chst. Tolle QualitÃ¤t, wie immer bei Bisgaard. Sehr schÃ¶ne Schuhe in bekannter Bisgaard QualitÃ¤t. Waren sofort der neue Lieblingsschuh beim Kind. Durch den Klettverschluss kÃ¶nnen die kleinen sie auch selbst an- und ausziehen, perfekt. Les chaussures sont trÃ¨s chouettes et taillent comme prÃ©vu. Jâ\\x80\\x99avais dÃ©jÃ\\xa0 achetÃ© cette marque.Par contre je dÃ©plore la mauvaise qualitÃ© du cuir, qui est rÃ¢pÃ© dÃ¨s la premiÃ¨re occasion (et elles ne manquent pas avec notre fils de 6 ans). Les semelles en cuir Ã\\xa0 lâ\\x80\\x99intÃ©rieur se sont dÃ©collÃ©es au niveau du gros doigt de pied et celui-ci est trÃ¨s marquÃ©.Bref vraiment la qualitÃ© nâ\\x80\\x99est pas au rendez-vous Muy cÃ³modos Ok, so normally New Balance shoes run a little small. My normal running shoes are Asics Gel Kayano 11.5 4E width. That is my absolute standard when it comes to fit and feel.When I usually purchase New Balance shoes, I get size 12 4E. Even then, its can be slightly short, but tolerable.  With these shoes, I started with the 12 4E. But man do they run long. The width seemed to be pretty accurate though.So I went with the 11.5 4E instead. They fit almost perfectly, except MAYBE a little long in the toes. However, I believe it were a size down, it would be a little too short.These are absolutely awesome on outdoor pickleball courts. I\\'ve easily put on about 20 hours of play on them, and they barely have any wear. I HIGHLY recommend and love them so much, I actually have a 2nd pair as backup. New Balance shoes are the only shoes I wear.  I own about 15 pair.  Always 8 1/2 to 9D.  This is much narrower than all my other shoes, right about where the arch is.  New Balance really screwed up here.  Long time buyers used to be able to find the newer model of a pair of shoes that they like but not any more.  I wish somebody at New Balance would listen to their customers. I wore 1004 4e, 1005 4e. Once NB made the 1006 the toe width got narrow. I figured Iâ\\x80\\x99d try these and they were comfortable for a 3 hour match. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how durable they will be but for now they were worth the money. Iâ\\x80\\x99m editing because after 6 weeks these shoes are not durable. I play ALOT of pickleball and platform tennis. Both are tough on shoes. Time will tell about the durability. But from a fit, weight, and mobility standpoint,  these IMO are best in class. I\\'ve tried several major brands and the umpteen different models they offer. I even tried other New Balance models. All we\\'re either too rigid, too loose, heavy, etc. Thank goodness for amazons return policy. Not mentioned, they look good too! Attractive style but too narrow and low for my wide, high instep, hammer toed feet. They killed my hammer toe. New Balance is my go to for racquetball and walking sneakers but these are narrower and lower at the toe than the 608s I uaually wear. Should have returned but kept past the return limit trying to break them in. My bad These tennis shoes are working very well. It gives me the advantage I was looking for. I purchased these sneakers in late July.  I have worn them a hand full of times and noted a very foul odor after each use.  I have always played sports and have never had this problem with any other court shoes in the past.  Because I have gone over the return window, I am forced to throw these shoes away and buy a different pair.  I am so disappointed. I paid over $84.00 for these sneakers. So far so good. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve only played on them a few times but the fit is good, the cushioning is good and they look great. Feel apart in less than a month of play. Einfache Halleschuche gute preis  gute Leistung  aber form ein bisschen klein bestellen sie 1 Nummer grosse Katastrophe. Pumas come small and narrow but overall design appears good. I don\\'t recommend first day After measuring my foot, following the size chart and ordering a 7, I could barely fit my foot in the shoe. Turns out I have an incredibly high instep, so I went a full size up to the 8. Fit like a glove! The arch support was in just the right spot - I\\'ve NEVER felt so supported by any boot before, hiking or otherwise. There is comfortable padding on the ankle, so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone. Also the weight of these boots is incredible. SO LIGHT!!! I feel like I\\'m wearing sneakers.The other day I took them for a \"test walk\" through a local stream, and while I stayed mostly on the sandy/muddy bank, I did occasionally walk through the water to see how the waterproofness held up. EXCELLENT! I could feel the coolness of the water but my socks stayed 100% dry.I\\'ve gotten lots of compliments already and they are by far the coolest looking hiking boots I\\'ve owned. I love that the design is not TOO overly \"outdoorsy\" looking and doesn\\'t have a lot of extra straps in the design (ie. keen or LL Bean  boots).Buy these boots and you won\\'t be sorry!! Donâ\\x80\\x99t waste your time with these.  So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that Iâ\\x80\\x99m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didnâ\\x80\\x99t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because itâ\\x80\\x99s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.  Once I got this through for Vasque to understand, they offered me a replacement pair of boots, making good with their warranty.  It was a fight, but I am getting new boots from the manufacturer. Just received bought the eggplant I love this show. Not hiked in it yet though. It has a high arch support, and a padded super comfy heap. So for people with heal pain great shoe. My normal size is 8.5, I ordered a 9 based on reviews that it runs small. Well I now need a 9.5 so asking seller if they will exchange. This is not a shoe for a wide footed person but if you are a regular Vasque purchaser you will know that. I would have given 5 stars but for the hassle of having to exchange and hope I donâ\\x80\\x99t get charged extra because shoe runs small! I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had these boots and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve really loved them. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got a nice tread that Iâ\\x80\\x99m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they donâ\\x80\\x99t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isnâ\\x80\\x99t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if Iâ\\x80\\x99m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when Iâ\\x80\\x99m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when Iâ\\x80\\x99m wearing my summer weight socks, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not get boiling hot feet. So thatâ\\x80\\x99s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to â\\x80\\x9cgoâ\\x80\\x9d in my work boots.So far, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been worth the investment! We will see in a few months how they actually hold up to eastern PA farming. I want to love these shoes, but there\\'s one MAJOR flaw with the design of these shoes witch make these a dealbreaker for me. I\\'ve been hiking for years, and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle.  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge, which means, when you lean your anke to the side, there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support, and you\\'re going down! All that time an money for product development, I\\'m surprised that this got overlooked. It\\'s a bummer, because these would otherwise be great shoes! If you want an expensive pair of comfortable rugged shoes for walking on flat surfaces, then these would be fine. The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fit...they literally fit like a glove - snug, and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot.  At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my footâ\\x80\\x99s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If youâ\\x80\\x99re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these â\\x80\\x9ctoo smallâ\\x80\\x9d.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isnâ\\x80\\x99t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary â\\x80\\x9cfeet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much Iâ\\x80\\x99m buying a second pair incase theyâ\\x80\\x99re discontinued. I have been using Vasque boots for over 20 years with great satisfaction.  Specially the Breeze series that is an exceptional combination between comfort, support and lightweight for hiking in hot weather.These shoes are exceptionally light but offer almost no support.  They are fresh foam based and overly flexible.  I am very disappointed and recommend not buying this product even to walk in the city, let alone for a trail... I read the reviews about the tightness. I don\\'t have wide feet. I wear thick socks too. I went a 1/2 size up like you should on hiking boots. They did seem snug at first but I wore around the house and decided to give them a try. I\\'m so glad I did. I either got used to them or they did seem to break without discomfort. That first time I realized I could run in them too!. I use these to run on hiking trails and my feet and legs don\\'t get tired. I love these boots/trail runners. FYI, they have a 6mm heel to toe drop. They are cute and very nicely made, but I can\\'t get comfortable in them. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a plain clothes police officer and I was looking for comfortable, good looking, daily wear all weather boots. I purchased these to try them out hoping theyâ\\x80\\x99d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i donâ\\x80\\x99t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know theyâ\\x80\\x99re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9â\\x80\\x99s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small. The difference may be negligible to most, but figured Iâ\\x80\\x99d mention it. I love wearing these and didnâ\\x80\\x99t realize there were boots out there quite this comfortable.*UPDATE*2 months in of almost daily wear, multiple outdoor range dates, 4 days straight of outdoor training at 8 hrs per day on my feet. These boots are absolutely outstanding, so comfortable, supportive and waterproof...my only gripe is the treads are so good that itâ\\x80\\x99s a little hard to get the mud and grass out of them afterwards... I ordered this shoe for my daughter and it was true to size.  She loved it.  The order was shipped in a timely manner and the price was reasonable. I love these hikers! They are extremely comfortable. I received them the day before my hiking trip and wore them to break them in, they were perfect. I wore them for about nine hours the next day and never felt more comfort. They were comfortable around foot, gave a little bounce back when I walked and great ankle support. I will say if you have a wider foot, this is not for you. I have a narrow to medium foot and at first was afraid of the snugness, but I was able to wear a thick hiking sock and it was fine. I would highly recommend these and will be purchasing more. Perfect fit, great price, happy daughter! I am now making up words to satisfy the minimum word count that is ridiculous. I got these shoes for my daughter who plays volleyball. Great purchase. She loves them. They are comfortable and really excels her game. Great shoes at a great price. Were delivered earlier than expected - which is always a good thing! Amazon is the way to go! Ho acquistato queste scarpe per utilizzarle in palestra, principalmente per step e allenamento funzionale. Svolgono egregiamente la loro funzione: hanno un buon grip,  sono carine, sono leggere, non molto traspiranti a mio parere, hanno l\\'aria abbastanza sintetica, ma per il prezzo pagato sono un\\'ottima alternativa. Le sconsiglio tuttavia a chi ha la pianta larga: sostengono il piede, con un elastico interno, che permetterebbe quasi di evitare di allacciarle, ma inizialmente stringe. Ormai le sto usando da un mese e sono portabili, ma all\\'inizio ho avuto paura di aver sbagliato numero, nonostante alla prima prova mi fossero sembrate giuste. Purtroppo la differenza si sente indossandole per un pÃ² di tempo: ad oggi, renderei un mezzo numero in piÃ¹. Las zapatillas estÃ¡n bien por el precio que pague ,la parte de delante hace una forma redondeada un poco extraÃ±a ,no las he estrenado en principio tienen pinta de ser cÃ³modas. Fit is snugger than I was expecting (tongue connected to the interior sole by elastic) so I notice it as I have a high arch.  One shoelace arrived with the end ripped off and frayed (missing piece not in box) making it too short and preventing me from lacing in the eyelets. Muy grandes Ottima calzata. Consiglio di prendere una taglia piÃ¹ grande perchÃ© vestono piccolo. Sono confortevoli e adatte soprattutto a chi fa crossfit. Muy contenta con este producto. Buen resultado y muy cÃ³modas para practicar CrossFit Son muy cÃ³modas y sujetan muy bien el pie. Las recomiendo. Son muy cÃ³modas, se ajustan bien al pie, el color es algo mÃ¡s llamativo que en la foto.Son ideales para work out , sin duda las recomiendo. Son muy cÃ³modas muy buena compra Son falsas Chaussures trÃ¨s jolies mais qui ne durent pas. Au prix quâ\\x80\\x99elles coÃ»tent dans les boutiques ou sur le net, câ\\x80\\x99est honteux. Je ne rachÃ¨terai plus jamais de chaussures de cette marque, je suis trop dÃ©Ã§ue par la qualitÃ©.

En cuanto a diseÃ±o bastante bonitas y discretas y muy comodas. A unos 80â\\x82¬ que la pude comprar es sencillamente espectacular, no se puede pedir mÃ¡s. BÃ¡sicamente son unas zapatillas trail running mÃ¡xima amortiguaciÃ³n para tener la posibilidad de largos trayectos tipo ultra.Son excelentes en casi todo quizÃ¡s los cordones son algo delgados pero puedes mejorar esto. Diese Schuhe sind einfach nur \"top\"!!!Total schÃ¶n von der Form, recht aufwendig und gut verarbeitet.Beinahe zu schade, sie zu tragen.Ich bin begeistert... Las zapatillas mÃ¡s cÃ³modas que he tenido. Si necesitas amortiguaciÃ³n estas son una gran opciÃ³n.La pena es que si las utilizas en asfalto se desgasta rÃ¡pidamente la suela.El resto de la zapatilla estÃ¡ impecable Der Schuh fÃ¤llt klein aus, normalerweise trage ich 45 bis 45 1/3 aber bei diesem Schuh sind es tatsÃ¤chlich 46 2/3.Der Schuh ist leicht und hat eine weiche Sohle die beim Laufen schÃ¶n dÃ¤mpft Son preciosas pero mejor pedir mÃ\\xadnimo 1 nÃºmero mÃ¡s... Las he tenido que devolver â\\x98¹ï¸\\x8f Ottimo prodotto acquistate anche in un\\'altra colorazione. Scarpe molto belle e comode, forse un po\\' calde in estate Son muy cÃ³modas ademÃ¡s de ligeras Habe dann gerade die letzten beiden PAARE in meiner GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe auch noch bestellt;-) Buenas zapatillas para caminos y/o pistas de tierra o piedra suelta El color me gustÃ³ mucho, es mÃ¡s rosa que como se ve en la foto, sÃ³lo no le doy 5 estrellas porque el acabado de la gamuza es mucho menos liso en un tenis que en el otro, pero ya puestos no se nota. Al principio se sentÃ\\xadan algo pesados por la plataforma pero estÃ¡n muy padres y cÃ³modos al caminar. Buen DÃ\\xadaestÃ¡n padrisimos los tenis pero la verdad no se si de casualidad manejan una talla mas pequeÃ±a es que si me queda casi un numero grandeojala pudieran contestarmegracias I got the olive green, great fit (with a half size down, my usual size). Great sole, great grip and very firm on the feet. Not loose at all. I am happy with the purchase. Loving these too much! I usually wear a Womenâ\\x80\\x99s size 7, but I got a 6.5 and they fit perfect. I have these in white size 7 and they run a little large. I would size down half a size. Super cute and comfortable! These are the most ill-fitting Pumas ive ever had. And the laces are more like ribbons than actually shoelaces. I have wider feet but that was never a problem with any other Pumas i\\'ve had. I had just got some similar orange platform ones and they were the best ever, these were the worst. Way too tight. i thought it was just me at first but then i didnt wear them for a while, and nothing else hurt my feet. Then i just thought i\\'d need to break them in, but i walked 10 painful miles at least in them over the past two months and my feet still hurt from wearing them two days ago. Nice color but shitty laces and too narrow. Firstly the package when getting these shoes  is phenomenal. IT is a box within another box. Very secure. Open feeling the shoes you notice it\\'s great quality. You can feel the laces are a step up from regular laces. I usually wear 9 but got a 9 1/2 due to shoes being a little narrow due to passed experiences. But the shoe fits to perfection and I got black to use more often . I absolutely love them ! Super nice and the platform helps with confidence and it\\'s slightly curved but it works well for back. Donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to say, canâ\\x80\\x99t tell itâ\\x80\\x99s true or fake product , thatâ\\x80\\x99s why gave 4 stars, but itâ\\x80\\x99s heavier than regular sneakers, it makes you look cool whatever style you are in, and color is way light than in the display picture, overall just wearing a regular branded sneaker which donâ\\x80\\x99t know true or fake. These shoes are adorable and the touches like the suede and ribbon laces make them stand out without being obnoxious. But the platform is made of concrete, I think? At least, it feels like I\\'m walking with bricks on my feet. There\\'s no flex at all and zero cushion. I\\'d say buy a size up and put an insert in, but they run kind of big, and even an insert wouldn\\'t make up for the fact that the shoes will not allow your foot to bend at all. I gave these shoes a three star because they are stylish and fit. However they are extremely uncomfortable to walk in. The built in insole feels like its designed to make your feet hurt. It would be fine If you could remove the insole it comes with but not only is it sewn in, its glued in as well, so to try and take it out your self would ruin the shoe. if you really want the shoe. Buy a size up and put a thick insole in and that will solve the problem. If you don\\'t feel like going through that don\\'t get the shoe. I love Geox shoes and I always buy size 10.5 which fit perfectly. This time I ordered my usual Geox size, but the shoes were too narrow. I returned them and ordered size 11 and they fit nicely. I bought them in the  blue colour which is darker than the pictures, more dark navy. Very elegant Sehr schÃ¶ner bequemer Schuh.Anziehen und loslaufen. Auch fÃ¼r komplizierte FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe gut geeignet.Die Farbe hellgrÃ¼n erscheint mir mit einem Touch hellblau.Passt sowohl zu hellen Hosen, wie auch sehr gut zu Jeans.Ich habe sie schon mit und ohne StrÃ¼mpfe getragen.Keine Probleme, von Fussgeruch keine Spur.Eben typisch Geox gut. Avevo giÃ\\xa0 provato questa marca quindi ho acquistato il numero a colpo sicuro. Ricevuto esattamente quello che mi aspettavo. Leider nur fÃ¼r schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe, ansonsten ein sehr schÃ¶ner Schuh. Sono belle ma, purtroppo, troppo stretto il solito numero che acquisto per le scarpe Geox (tenendo conto che le metto con i calzini). Sono dovuta passare al numero piÃ¹ grande. Very nice shoes, good fit, but litlle bit narrow Prese come regalo. Chi l\\'ha ricevute apprezza eleganza e traspirabilitÃ\\xa0 che Ã¨ la qualitÃ\\xa0 di ogni Geox. Prezzo interessante. tolle Schuhe Good shoes but a little bit small. Toller angenehmer Schuh einfach Geox. Son muy cÃ³modas y preciosas.Quedan bien para salir.No le doy 5* porque el nÃºmero 37 me venÃ\\xada muy justo y me comprÃ© el 38, y Ã©ste me queda algo suelto, hay mucha diferencia entre nÃºmeros. Scarpe originale,calzano giusto,,, bellissime Son muy cÃ³modas y bonitas justo lo esperado TrÃ¨s jolie ! Top wie alle Schuhe dieser Marke, die ich bis jetzt gekauft habe.Gerade bei Kinderschuhen lege ich sehr groÃ\\x9fen Wert auf gutes Schuhwerk. Da ist es klar, dass man die nicht fÃ¼r 10â\\x82¬ bekommt. QualitÃ¤t hat eben ihren Preis und hier ist er gerechtfertigt. Super schÃ¶ner Schuh! Farbe ist live noch schÃ¶ner als auf den Bildern!Passt perfekt. Wie immer bei Superfit. Ich kaufe fÃ¼r meine Tochter eigentlich nur Superfit Schuhe, da hier einfach die QualitÃ¤t stimmt! ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8dð\\x9f\\x8f½ Hatten mehrere Modelle zur Auswahl bestellt. Dieses gefiel nicht so gut.Aber es passt super. Ist bequem. WunderschÃ¶ne und trotzdem stabile Sandalen mit toller Sohle. Superfit ist einfach fantastisch! Wie erwartet sind die Super fit Schuhe wieder top. Sie sind klasse verarbeitet,  passen wie angegossen und erwarten eine lange Tragdauer. Ich finde das Design sehr schÃ¶n. Schlicht mit ein paar kleinen Details. Der Schuh hat meiner Tochter sehr gut gefallen und ich habe ihn ein zweites Mal bestellt. Bequemer, flexibler Schuh. Super schÃ¶ne Schuhe in bewÃ¤hrter Superfit-QualitÃ¤t! Nice look, good fit and very good price for this brand. SchÃ¶ne Sandale! Passt zu allem! Schicke und bequeme Sandalen. Farbe und GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fenangaben sind wie angegeben. Nada que ver el modelo que pedÃ\\xad , y debido a que soy fan de esta marca los conservarÃ© para un regalo navideÃ±o . Los seleccionados eran con camuflaje en verde olivo y llegaron en color  amarillo fosforescente . Love the shoes, hate the packaging from Amazon! This may be small to others, but I keep my boxes for all my shoes and Amazon shipped my shoes in a plastic bag instead of a box. When I received the shoes my box was destroyed. Me gustaron mucho pero tengo que regresar el producto porque, aunque los pedÃ\\xad de la talla que habitualmente uso, me quedaron muy justos tanto de lo largo como del empeine del pie. Si se deciden por ellos pidan por lo menos un nÃºmero mÃ¡s grande del que usan. Muy bien producto, en caja original. Parfait I wear a women\\'s size 12 US which generally translates to a men\\'s size 10. After reading the reviews, I ordered a 10.5 and I could not be happier! I love the look of these shoes. I removed the laces. Since the shoe fits like a sock and I don\\'t plan on running in them, I didn\\'t really see a point of having the laces there. Plus they kinda rubbed my foot in a weird way. They feel absolutely perfect without laces. I have a rather narrow foot. If you have a wide foot, I don\\'t think you would find this shoe to your liking. The grey color is perfect for me and I love the little splashes on the tread at the side. I also love the weave look of the shoe. Overall, a great shoe at a great price! Ive own two other HyperGEL-KAN shoes and I love them all. These shoes breathe easily and feel great once you break them in. I wear these daily. People say they run a bit small but I think for being being \"athletic\" shoes they fit different. So you should go one size bigger and give them a try. Very comfortable. I thought they were too small vertically at first, but after breaking them in they are very comfortable.Only good for running on flat surfaces, no ankle support. Tried running on a trail and rolled ankle within 30 seconds. I did buy a size up due to previous reviews and I am glad I did. Shoes are very comfortable. I have a lot of issue with my arches and the balls of my feet but while wearing these shoes I have had no pain. It was time for some new shoes so these were chosen. Great quality shoe and very comfortable. I took the shoelaces out for extra comfort and notice the fabric giving me more flexibility. Love these shoes! Amazing shoe. Very comfortable. My size is a 10 would recommend a 10.5 or even 11 if you have a wide foot. I got an 11 and fits me great and feels good. Top collar was to tight to get my foot inside the shoe!! That was with the laces loosened all the way !!Returned them for refund Muy bien !

It\\'s a bit heavy, but it\\'s a waterproof (GORE-TEX) hiking shoe with thick sole, so it\\'s expected.Unfortunately, did not work for me.  Going half size up was a good decision, but the shoe feels tight around the arch, and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable. To add insult to injury (no pun intended, although I can easily imagine injuries at pressure points after long hikes), it really cuts bad into the foot just proximal to the toes, and only one shoe. Virtually impossible to walk without discomfort. Sadly, no matter how much I liked them, had to return. I loved the shoe but unfortunately didnâ\\x80\\x99t work for me. I apparently needed a wider width so have to go to a specialty store for my shoes. I ordered size 5 in wide, it fits me so perfect, love the design, color, very helpful for me for my 8 hours work at the hospital and it gives me height as well. Love them . Great running shoes Fit as expected. My husband is an iron worker. Used these less than a month and the seams are already popping/leather didnâ\\x80\\x99t hold up well. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re comfortable but that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean much when they fall apart less than a month in. Construction.....si vous portez du 10.... nâ\\x80\\x99hÃ©sitez pas Ã\\xa0 commander du 9.5..... a part Ã§a câ\\x80\\x99est un bon produit..... les semelles intÃ©rieures sont ordinaires aussi....vous pouvez penser Ã\\xa0 les remplacer dÃ¨s lâ\\x80\\x99achat I\\'ve worn these boots to work for 10 days and the leather is already peeling and cracking. I used mink oil when new and wore them around the house for a few days to break them in. I\\'m a crane operator so fair to say my boots don\\'t typically see a lot of rough environment. It\\'s really too bad because they are very comfortable and look great.  Guess that\\'s why they\\'re cheap. Comfortable and light boot, specially like the soft rubber sole instead of soft foam, took about 2 weeks to break them in, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s typical. They are a snug boot, Iâ\\x80\\x99m a size 10 in timberland pro, or Dakota lined boot, 9-1/2 unlined dakotas,  these I went with a 9-1/2 because they are unlined, glad I did. Great price, would definitely buy them again. Well made and very comfortable itâ\\x80\\x99s large fitting so you can go down half size. I bought the soft toe and steel toe, they look well made and hope they last I bought these for my son, he was pleased said the fit was good maybe a little big in the width, overall a good workboot. I haven\\'t broken them in yet but so far they are comfortable,will they last as long as my Thorogoods... to be continued... Hard to break in. But once they do they are comfy. Took 2 weeks to break in with mink oil I bought these forMy husband and so far these are his favorite boots of all time :) he actually wants another pair toWear all the time and one for work cause they fit great there comfy and they look great !! Great purchase The sole was cracked Where the sole meats the leather on the arch portion of the foot. This causes the boot to leak. Should have returned them right away. Bought 2 pairs but only 1 pair had the cracked soles. Beautiful shoe but fits in the small size. I am an avid cyclist and tried to make these shoes work by adjusting my cleats repeatedly and even ordered insoles. They just arenâ\\x80\\x99t comfortable and make my feet hurt and toes go to sleep even though I loosen them and the fit is not tight. Will only use my Sidis now. Love that you can often find expensive cycling gear and reasonable prices on Amazon!  I have a slightly narrow foot and have trouble finding road bike shoes that fit my foot securely and comfortably.  These are perfect and were at least $100 more on many other websites.  Most road bike shoes that fit me are $200+, so I was relieved to snag these from amazon! Love these shoes! Wear them to spin class and they work perfect! Very comfortable Nice pair of cycling shoes. Fake fake fake... In genere d\\'estate indosso infradito o scarpe da trekking, ma questa estate devo rinunciare a qualsiasi tipo di sandalo perchÃ© indosso calze elastiche. Ho cercato perciÃ² scarpe che fossero il piÃ¹ possibile fresche, morbide, leggere, che non aumentassero troppo il caldo provocato dalle calze. Ho  avuto la fortuna di trovare queste  le Salomon Tech Lite!Semplicemente perfette.  Ed anche molto carine! son soddisfatta. Sehr bequemer Schuh. Guter fester Sitz, aber trotzdem locker leichtes GefÃ¼hl. Perfekt zum Spaziergang bei hohen Temperaturen. confortable et aerÃ©. Je trouve toutefois que salomon taille un peu grand. J\\'ai du changer la semelle (pour une geox cuir) celle d\\'origine etant tres inconfortable et j\\'ai egalement mis des lacets elastiques qui a mon avis tiennent mieux le pied que les lacets d\\'origine (trop longs a mon gout) There are the best water shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve worn. Super comfy, good fit, and look nice. They work well on river rock and water drains well from them. You are able to go from forest floor to river no problem. Love them! Ein leichter Sommerschuh zum Sport. Das Material ist wunderbar weich. Leider ist die Innensohle nicht austauschbar. Der Schuh ist schÃ¶n luftig, angenehm breit geschnitten, nur ist mir das Fussbett im Bereich der Ferse zu hart.... The bottom of the shoe is solid and bendy which is great, but the sides and back of the shoe is flimsy and will be a problem around the sides of my feet. Love the solid sole of this light weight shoe but wish Iâ\\x80\\x99d bought it a 1/2 size smaller. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good looking stylish shoe, but there is slippage in the heel when walking. Perfectos, tal como lo esperaba. Ligeros y super cÃ³modos Der Schuh ist echt ein Hingucker. Ich finde ihn super modisch und total bequem. Die Passform ist ja sehr individuell. Damit sich da jeder selbst ein Bild machen kann, habe ich die Einlagen anbei als Foto vermessen. Der Schuh ist schmal geschnitten ,sitzt eher fest. FÃ¼r krÃ¤ftige FÃ¼sse sicherlich nicht das Beste.Das Material ist gut verarbeitet und der Schuh hat ein leichtes Gewicht, was ich sehr gut finde.Preis/Leistung ok In den Schuh reingeschlÃ¼pft und habe mich â\\x80\\x9ezu Hauseâ\\x80\\x9c gefÃ¼hlt.  Der Sneeker gefÃ¤llt mir optisch genau so gut, wie er mir Bein Gehen passt. Habe den Sneaker, nachdem ich ihn letztes Jahr in safrangelb gekauft habe, jetzt noch in dunkelblau bestellt. Bei Marco Tozzi nehme ich immer die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 39, normal trage ich Gr. 38. Passen perfekt und sind durch das FuÃ\\x9fbett sehr bequem.Die elastischen SchnÃ¼rsenkel sorgen fÃ¼r ein gutes TragegefÃ¼hl.Lieferung war sehr schnell und der Preis hat auch gepaÃ\\x9ft. Schick und vor allenbequem dazu noch modisch und klasse imDesign, tolle Farbe, super leicht und gute Passform Bequeme Sneaker fÃ¼r den Ã\\x9cbergang mit loser Lederinnensohle.Noch dazu bei dem Preis unschlagbar. Schnell geliefert. Farbecht, wie auf dem Foto. Gern wieder. Die Schuhe sind optisch ein Hingucker,dazu noch sehr bequem.Einfach Klasse! Toller Schuh, passt perfekt, schÃ¶ne Farbe. Toller Sneaker und Farbe. Hat eine gute Passform, auf die ich mich immer verlassen kann. Ich bin ehrlich ich habe fÃ¼r den Preis nicht besonders viel erwartet wÃ¼rde jedoch Ã¼berrascht. Das Material und die Verarbeitung sind echt gut. Auch der trage Komfort ist ok. Wie lange diese Schuh Sohlen halten kann ich nicht beurteilen da mir die von mir bestellten Schuhe zu gross sind. Einziges Manko sind die schnÃ¼rrsenkel. SchnÃ¼rt man sie normal fest drÃ¼cken sie das sie im Durchmesser zu schmal und rund sind. Die Schuhe wurden schnell geliefert und waren nach dem Auspacken ein echter Hingucker.... sehen Klasse aus und sind sehr leicht am Fuss . Im Urlaub bei Ã¼ber 30 Grad gab es auch keinen  \" Butterfuss \" ..... angenehmer Tragekomfort , jederzeit wieder Schnelle Lieferung. Schuh ist leicht. Bequem zu tragen. Gepolsterte Laufsohle sorgt fÃ¼r weiches Auftreten beim laufen. Nicht Wasserdicht. Gutes PreisleistungsverhÃ¤ltnis. Kaufempfehlung Leider musste ich feststellen,dass der kauf ein groÃ\\x9fer Reinfall war ob wohl ich die grÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 41 bestellt die ich bekommen habe sieht die grÃ¶Ã\\x9fe wie 39 zuklein. Ich bin mehr als entÃ¤ucht weil ich extra 5â\\x82¬ wegen schneller lieferung bezahlt die kommt 3 tage spÃ¤t als die lieferung zeit stand Wie beschriebenen, sehr gutes Produkt.SeriÃ¶ser VerkÃ¤ufer, schnelle Lieferung, ohne Beanstandungen. Bin zufrieden. Passt genau! Toller stil Troppo piccole Sehen gut aus, lassen sich gut tragen. Mal abwarten,wie lange sie halten! Come scritto prima sono strette sul collo del piede e sono fastidiosi ad indossarle ma nell insieme e un ottimo prodotto Finally a non-branded product that\\'s great value and quality. Happy about my purchase. I normally wear 7.5.  I had to return and get a 7 which is still a generous fit but works. Llegaron muy bien The toe box is tight but they fit nice as long as you get the right size.  I\\'ve already owned a pair of these that I bought in a retail store and they are fantastic.  This is a replacement pair.  Can\\'t even remember how many complements I\\'ve gotten, even from total strangers.Just remember to buy the right size LOL.  I clicked on the wrong size when I ordered so the pair I got is too small.  It was my fault though, and I\\'m going to just give them away to someone who might need them.  Already bought another pair in the right size (although I think they came from a different Amazon seller that time) and they are on the way. Shoes are narrow. Love, super comfortable, as advertised bad quality!!!! dented!!! unvalued shoes!! Itâ\\x80\\x99s really comfortable Son muy bonitas pero la talla muy pequeÃ±a. Uso un 38-39 y la 39 me iba muy pequeÃ±a. Una pena que hubiera un 40 Dopo aver acquistato alcune scarpe della Geox ho deciso di prendere anche un paio di stivaletti.COME VANNO?Abitualmente uso il 44 ma sulle calzature Geox prendo sempre il 43 e mi vanno bene. Ho fatto cosÃ¬ anche in questo caso e mi sono trovato bene.  Ã\\x88 inutile girarci intorno, non si puÃ² dare una regola precisa perchÃ© dipende dalla forma del vostro piede. In questo caso trattandosi di stivaletti dovete tenere presente che se avete le caviglie grandi potrebbe essere un problema il numero in meno e allora conviene il vostro numero usuale.MATERIALILa pelle Ã¨ sempre di buona qualitÃ\\xa0. Gli stivali non sono lucidi ma piuttosto opachi quindi se vi piace la pelle lucida optate per altri modelli. A me piacciono cosÃ¬.CONCLUSIONIBuon prodotto. Grazie alla scuola Geox che lascia respirare il piede si sta bene e non si suda, cosa difficile con altri tipi di stivaletti. Acquisto consigliato soprattutto in offerta intorno ai 50 euro! In quel caso da prendere subito.Spero abbiate gradito la recensione. Saluti! Sehr angenehm zu tragender und schÃ¶ner Schuh.Was die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe angeht, so sollte man den FuÃ\\x9f messen und die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe ermitteln. Ich habe in lang geschnittenen Herrenschuhen grundsÃ¤tzlich eine GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe weniger wie in Turn- bzw Freizeitschuhen, was sicherlich auch an meinem schmalen FuÃ\\x9f liegt.BezÃ¼glich vermeintlicher Kratzer auf den Schuhen, die hier auch als Foto gezeigt wurden, muss man sich keine Sorgen machen. War bei mir auch der Fall und ich habe schnell festgestellt, dass es nur an zu viel Schuhcreme ab Werk liegt. Daher auf jeden Fall vor erstem Gebrauch mal mit der SchuhbÃ¼rste drÃ¼ber, damit dann auch Nichts abfÃ¤rbt.Abzuwarten bleibt, wie haltbar ReiÃ\\x9fverschluÃ\\x9f und Sohle sind. Die Sohle ist ziemlich dÃ¼nn - wer das nicht mag, sollte einen anderen Schuh wÃ¤hlen. Bizarre,une chaussure n\\'allait pas du tout, la couture  Ã©tait si mal faite que j\\'aurais pu l\\'arracher rien qu\\'en tirant un peu...De plus la languette extÃ©rieure n\\'Ã©tait pas droite, et enfin les deux languettes ne prÃ©sentaient pas du tout du tout la mÃªme longueur.Je veux bien que deux chaussures d\\'une mÃªme paire puissent Ãªtre diffÃ©rentes, mais lÃ\\xa0 c\\'est vraiment bizarre.Et j\\'ajouterai que la rÃ©fÃ©rence inscrite Ã\\xa0 l\\'intÃ©rieur n\\'Ã©tait pas complÃ¨te - rien de dramatique Ã\\xa0 ce niveau-lÃ\\xa0 mais assez suspect pour que j\\'achÃ¨te cette mÃªme paire chez un concurrent - et lÃ\\xa0 bizarrement, aucun problÃ¨me d\\'aucune nature...De lÃ\\xa0 Ã\\xa0 parler de contrefaÃ§on, il n\\'y a qu\\'un pas...TrÃ¨s dÃ©Ã§u et je ne ne les recommande pas - pas chÃ¨res mais pas de qualitÃ© - et Ã§a se voit. Habe den Schuh in 42 bestellt nachdem ich gelesen habe das Sie zu groÃ\\x9f ausfallen. 41 haette auch locker gereicht.Das Leder ist nicht 100% glatt aber das ist fÃ¼r ein echtes Leder irgendwie ok.Nicht ok ist die Verarbeitung, nach 2maligen Tragen verliert der Schuh seine Form, es fehlt ein festeres Gewebe das das weiche Leder in Position hÃ¤lt. Hatte aufgrund der vielen negativen Bewertungen, dass der Schuh viel zu groÃ\\x9f ausfallen wÃ¼rde, GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 45 statt 46 bestellt. Leider ein Fehler, da die 45er zu klein sind. Gar nicht unbedingt von der GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe der Sohle her, aber vom KnÃ¶chel und der Ferse hat es doch unangenehm und deutlich gedrÃ¼ckt. Daher nun 46er bestellt, ich habe immer so zwischen 45 und 46, je nach Hersteller und die passen nun perfekt und sitzen bequem. Insofern nicht unbedingt eine, oder zwei Nummer zu groÃ\\x9f. Zumindest nicht bei mir. 4 Sterne, da leichte Spuren auf der Oberseite zu sehen sind. Dies mag bei dieser Lederart vorkommen, jedoch ist dieser Umstand eben keine 5 Sterne wert, wenn diese direkt bei Neuen Schuhen auftritt. Ich hoffe das Paar begleitet mich langjÃ¤hrig als komfortabler und ab und an getragenes Schuhwerk. Geruch ledrig angenehm, Sohle aus Kunststoff. Articolo ricevuto in una scatola non originale alla sua, prodotto usato con evidenti difetti e tanti graffi nella parte davanti, sulla punta. Pagati come nuovi e ricevuti usati. Sono talmente arrabbiato che avvio subito il reso. Amazon, grande delusione questa volta! Etwas zu groÃ\\x9f als meine gewÃ¶hnliche SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe, ReiÃ\\x9fVerschluss ist solide, optisch hÃ¤tte ich mir es feiner vorgestellt, in Wahrheit sieht es fast so aus wie als hÃ¤tte man Gummistiefel halbiert. Dennoch erfÃ¼llt es seinen Zweck, Material ist in Ordnung. Buenos botines.  Buen acabado y una piel muy buena.  Muy cÃ³modas, como zapatillas.  Una muy buena compra Chaussures dans Ã©tat LAMENTABLE le cuir est usÃ© et ou griffÃ© dur 60% de la surface !!!Le tout envoyÃ© dans une boÃ®te deux fois trop grande pour les maintenir correctement.Paire commandÃ©e en remplacement d\\'une premiÃ¨re commande arrivÃ©e dans les mÃªme conditions. Je vous conseille vivement d\\'inspecter votre stock car n\\'a de geox que l\\'Ã©tiquette... Retour dÃ¨s demain. Wie von der Marke erwartet, passt wie angegossen, gute Verarbeitung und sehr schnelle Lieferung. Gerne wieder. These sneakers are attractive, lightweight, and the overall construction seems good. I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids\\' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the \"wide\" width even though they don\\'t have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can\\'t lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess. I\\'ve been pleased with New Balance in the past and will continue to purchase their products. BUT, I will absolutely make sure I never purchase sneakers with unadjustable, fixed laces again! Whatâ\\x80\\x99s not to love? This may be the BEST shoes for kids! It is my absolute favorite of all the amount of shoes ever purchased for my kids, this is hands down the most amazing pair. It does not require the kids to tie (faster for kids to put on), comfort fit, great colors and design, no snagging on the tongue of shoes nor does it elastic on the â\\x80\\x9clacesâ\\x80\\x9d become loose! Even my kids say itâ\\x80\\x99s now their favorite. Wished the shoes industry would make more of these for kids!! The best invention of shoes for kids. You will not regret purchasing! far too often I find myself writing reviews saying others knew what they were talking about.  My son has fairly narrow feet but after wearing these 1 or 2 times he told me they weren\\'t comfortable and pointed to the end of the \\'laces\\' as hurting.I believe the problem is that the elastic \"laces\" don\\'t adjust very much.  I was able to pull the elastic out there and make a little bit of an adjustment so hopefully we can get SOME wear out of them...wish I could return them though.If your child has wider feet, as mine always have been, you shouldn\\'t even consider this product. weâ\\x80\\x99ve saved ourselves some drama getting ready for school in the morning because these shoes are lightweight and easy to get on and off. Another reviewer said the elastic laces make them a little big, but we havenâ\\x80\\x99t found that to be true in our case- I assume it depends on how theyâ\\x80\\x99re sized to your child.We also got a really good deal on these!! My 10 year old son picked these out. They looked really good and fit him well. The only problem is the elastic laces. When he runs, plays or makes a cut, his foot slides out. He really did not like wearing them because he could not play in them. I had to cut out the elastic laces and replace them with regular tennis show laces. These shoes are FANTASTIC!  I have 2 boys who constantly run around with their shoes untied.  These have been a life saver for kids who have not yet learned to tie their shoes.  Plus they are stylish, sturdy, and reasonably priced.  I came back the website just to order more sizes as they grow, don\\'t ever get rid of this product! Super lightweight, nice shoes. The only thing is bc of the elastic laces, they are a little loose if your child has narrow feet. Great price and came quick. These sneakers slip on easily. They were labeled wide width but I donâ\\x80\\x99t find them very wide. They are a full size larger on my sonâ\\x80\\x99s foot, but the 10.5 W shoes we have from New Balance are too short! Off sizing. Nice color and quality overall. A lightweight sneaker. These shoes are great for my little guy. They\\'re comfortable and they are really nice looking. He has wide feet and typically has a problem with other shoes. He LOVES these.  I actually didn\\'t know when I purchased them that they were slip ons and didnt have actual laces. This made him even more happy. Great buy! I have never tried New Balance for my 3 almost 4 year old before. He is disabled and stride rites always seem to fit him wide. These little New Balance shoes fit him perfectly. He has room to grow, they are narrow enough that I don\\'t have to purchase special narrow shoes and with the stretchy faux ties he is trying to put them on himself. 2 Things: 1- it is true size (a lot of the shoes on Amazon, may not be , but this is..), so if you are size 8, order 8 not 81/2. 2- They are one of the comfortable ones in maybe hundreds.. because I have had to order more than 20 different models, to finally find this to be only the 2nd one that was as comfy a fit as it looks, plus it is an Adidas, so it is quality.The problem: it was used and the box and inside of it were reallllly bad too, and they lie easily : When I ordered it, it said there was only 1 left(Which I got) , but just before returning them, I checked again, and no messages like that!!!! so my rating applies to \"This particular pair ONLY\" ... BUT THE SHOE IS A GREAT SHOE.. Fits perfect to size and I love the color! the shoes are for man , not for woman, as they say in the description. Everything is okay ð\\x9f¤£ I love them I just wish they had them in my size in the white Buenas y cÃ³modas de calidad media I have a wider foot and these fit great. Super comfortable and easy to wash (after being out in the mud I put them through the washing machine and they came out good as new). Love these! So light, comfortable, and look super cute! Good looking shoe. The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and thatâ\\x80\\x99s soooo annoying. But determined to want to keep them because they are attractive and slip on (I wanted them for a work from home house shoe.) I put a pair of Dr. Scholls in soles inside them. Theyâ\\x80\\x99d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. Iâ\\x80\\x99d say if youâ\\x80\\x99re looking for a â\\x80\\x9chouse slipperâ\\x80\\x9d quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great. Without the insoles, I would have had to return them. I really dont like these. They fit strange and are not comfortable. I have several pairs of sneaker type shoes for work and these are at the very bottom of my rotation to wear. Wish i had just gone to kohls or something to try before i bought them. They are narrow and too big. This is the size i normally buy in shoes but they are too big length wise and too small width wise for my feet. I bought these shoes for casual, comfy days.  Do I plan on running in these?  No.  In all fairness, I probably wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t run in any shoes (unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth).  These shoes were instantly comfortable. I wear a 9-9.5.  The ball part of my foot is med to wide; the heel of my foot is narrow. These work great.  I ordered 9.5 and these are true to size. They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I donâ\\x80\\x99t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes. Iâ\\x80\\x99d say one too many ice creams or getting into deadly fight triggered by one too many renditions of â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a Small World.â\\x80\\x9d Our daughter is a varsity basketball player.  Most players finish practice and go to their \"slides\".  She wanted something that was easy to slip into but still secure as she has to drive about 30 miles to the practice facility.She loves them and wears them all the time.  Around the house, running errands, pre & post practice.  She says that they are super comfortable.  Highly Recommend. I am highly impressed with these tennis shoes. Very comfortable. I have worn them for 16 hours straight with no problem! This is huge for me because my arches usually start to hurt. No problems at all. Fits true to size. Light-weight, and love the style. These shoes DO feel like a cloud. They are so comfortable. I\\'ve never owned any adidas but I\\'m so glad my friends told me to buy these. They feel like sneaker slippers due to not having a shoe tongue...they feel great to run in. I would only suggest to size down though! Got a 9.5 and could have easily done a 9. These are comfortable and I love that they are pull on. I love the simple and classic design. They definitely run big- Amazon said â\\x80\\x9cfits as expectedâ\\x80\\x9d and recommended a size 10. I got a 9.5 based on other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s reviews and actually could have gone with a 9. So they are comfortable for walking but I would not want to run in them! I would buy again but definitely recommend going down a size or two. Love these shoes!  I am a teacher and I am on my feet all day.  I love these shoes and highly recommend them. Converse All Star hi Canvas perfettamente originali vendute e spedite da Amazon ,ho controllato anche nel sito web delle converse e la scarpa Ä\\x97 perfetta , pagate 50â\\x82¬ in offerta direi che ci siamo. Per la taglia io porto il 42 e ho preso la taglia 41 (corrisponde a 26 cm scritto nell\\'etichetta delle scarpe)  che Ä\\x97 perfetta come calzata. Nella pagina del venditore c\\'Ã¨ una foto con le taglie ma secondo me quelle non corrispondono anche perchÃ© se avessi preso la tg 42 mi sarebbe risultata grande. La marca se nota en su calidad. Son muy cÃ³modas y se ajustan perfectamente al pie/tobillo pero sin exficcia. La verdad es que la suela tambiÃ©n es cÃ³moda parece que vueles por su elestucidad. Un producto 100% recomendable. All\\'interno verso la punta  c\\'Ã¨ una cucitura mal rifinita che irrita il dito del piede quindi le uso se nn Ã¨ previsto lunghe passeggiate. Peccato perchÃ© sono molto carine Puedo decir que son las ALL STAR autÃ©nticas. Hice la comprobaciÃ³n con las mismas que me compre en la tienda Converse y no he encontrado ninguna diferencia, ademÃ¡s que son igual de cÃ³modas, cosa que con algunas imitaciones que he comprado la comodidad no estÃ¡ presente aunque parezcan la original.

Sehr bequemer Schuh, auch zum lange laufen. El acabado es d e primera, la comodidad casi de 10, el pero es un relieve de la costura a nivel del talÃ³n de aquÃ\\xadles, roza un poco dando una leve molestia. Son livianas, muy suaves para caminar, con un toque elegante. Finalmente le quito dos estrellas, porque las dos zapatillas me han hecho daÃ±o en el talÃ³n de aquÃ\\xadles, de que sirve unos zapatos tan chulos si no puedes caminar mucho con ellos.

Ne ho acquistate due a pochi giorni di distanza perchÃ© in offerta entrambe. Pagate una â\\x82¬19 e l\\'altra poco piÃ¹ di â\\x82¬19 forse se ricordo bene â\\x82¬19.39. Due paia di scarpe a nemmeno il prezzo di una! La mia preferita Ã¨ quella color salmone perchÃ© ha un colore piÃ¹ marcato. Comunque ho acquistato la mia solita taglia che normalmente acquisto per le Diadora cioÃ¨ mezzo numero in piÃ¹ (38.5). Io calzo 38. PerÃ² questo modello di scarpa a mio parere non serve il mezzo numero in piÃ¹ ,un 38 mi sarebbe comunque andato bene perchÃ© la pianta della scarpa Ã¨ molto larga. Per quanto riguarda l\\'uso della scarpa, deve essere indossata nelle mezze stagioni, non Ã¨ invernale. Purtroppo la scarpa era troppo stretta nonostante avessi preso mezzo numero in piÃ¹ e ho dovuto restituirle perchÃ© ero prossima alla partenza per le ferie ma il venditore Ã¨ stato molto disponibile, gentile e corretto. Non ho ancora indossato le scarpe perchÃ¨ sono ancora un po\\' leggere rispetto la stagione. Devo dire che comunque le ho indossate in casa  e mi sono trovata bene. Aspetto la primavera inoltrata per poterle usare all\\'aperto e vedere come  vanno. Mi ha affascinato il colore.Purtroppo mi aspettavo pesassero di meno.Non trovo indicata per lunghe passeggiate.

In base all\\'acquisto sembra essere perfetto in quanto avevamo ordinato questo e NON Ã© arrivato un koala. Perfette. Bellissime. Ne compreremo altre per fargli compagnia. Carine e finora robuste.

Ottime Ne ho acquistato piÃ¹ paia sono comodissime e belle Sandali discreti ma non mi fanno impazzire. Uno degli aspetti positivi e che sono semplici da mettere ai piedi della piccola, inoltre hanno un sistema di chiusura a velcro che permette di adattare al meglio la calzatura alla misura del piede. La suola Ã¨ troppo ampia secondo me: la piccola ha avuto bisogno di un poâ\\x80\\x99 di tempo per abituarsi. sono troppo rumorosi quando si cammina. Potevano costare qualcosina in meno Sehr schÃ¶ne Schuhe. Meine Tochter 5 zieht sie sehr gern an. Sie hat einen sehr schmalen FuÃ\\x9f, durch die Klettachnallen sitzt der Schuh schÃ¶n eng am FuÃ\\x9f. Superleicht sind sie zudem auch noch! ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Talla perfecto,y sÃºper cÃ³modas These are cute but were too â\\x80\\x9cclunkyâ\\x80\\x9d for my 3 1/2 year old. They didnâ\\x80\\x99t adjust small enough to fit her and the base of the sandal didnâ\\x80\\x99t bend so she was unable to walk in them. We returned them, which the seller was great about. I would not recommend for littler kids, but perhaps ages 6 and up. These are nice, casual summer sandals -- great for beach, pool, etc.  Daughter loves them!  Sizing seems OK in the kids\\' sizes.  The main drawbacks we see so far are:1. the rainbow-colored straps show dirt very easily, and2. while the foam footbed is soft & comfy, it will wear down fast I wanted to love these shoes for my daughter BUT they were too small. We were sent a infant size and thatâ\\x80\\x99s not what I purchased. When receiving these shoes off the bat I realized these were something for looks rather than looks and being comfortable for my toddler to either A dress up in and B be able to walk for hours in them without cutting in to her feet. Sadly these werenâ\\x80\\x99t what I thought they were! These are the best shoes for kids! So comfortable and they last for a long time! These have been the perfect summer shoes for my 7 year old daughter. She can run and play in them and they hold up great. I bought a second pair because we love them so much. And super stylish, surfer-like look too. Cute and comfy sandals- fits perfectly on my daughter.

Tengo cogida la talla en Clarks tengo un 44 y pido siempre 44,5, son perfectos y comodos Los zapatos son frescos y cÃ³modos, ideales para el verano, pero con el calor aparece una marca que coincide con el pegamento interior que parece unir el protector de la puntera, y no logro quitarlo con una toallita ni nada por el estilo, por lo que, despuÃ©s de usarlos dos veces, los llevas marcados sin remedio.No los volverÃ\\xada a comprar. Son unas zapatillas de tela de calidad aceptable pero peor a lo acostumbrado en Clarks.

Alle Schuhe wurden ohne Innensohle geliefert. Was nun ?Ich habe diese Hausschuhe in der Vergangenheit regelmÃ¤Ã\\x9fig  mehrfach bestellt und war immer sehr zufrieden.Ohne Innensohle bieten diese Schuhe keine TragequalitÃ¤t. Eigentlich 5 Sterne leider jetzt nur 1 Se las comprÃ© a mi hijo de 10 aÃ±os y le quedan perfectas, muy cÃ³modas. Sind wirklich gut und QualitÃ¤t stimmt auch Beautiful but too small. I ordered the wrong size schnelle lieferung ware ok gerne wieder The shoe itself was exactly what I had expected. I bought this to replace a worn pair at the same size and this was larger somehow than my previous pair. Pretty sure that I haven\\'t shrunk since I purchased the last pair sooooo. Love these shoes. They fit my big feet (size 12) perfectly Super comfy and easy to slide on. Used them almost all the time till my previous pair literally gave out... which is when I bought the exact same pair. Most comfortable shoes I own.  Look great too! I love these shoes. Love them I love these sneakers (I bought 2 in white - in case one pair needed a wash!) and I think I\\'ll get another n a color. I have always liked Sherry shoes and these were a good price The shoes were as advertised and arrived on time. The shoes are a bit tight (no wide width available) but the length is accurate.  Good quality and very nice looking. Love them Titel: ARA Damen Rom Sneaker und auf dem Foto ein Schuh mit ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss.Geliefert wurde ein brauner ARA Osaka ohne ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss.Deshalb RÃ¼cksendung. Schuh passt sehr gut,  sehr gute QualitÃ¤t der Schuhe, passen wie erwartet, sehr bequem Man sollte allerdings auf die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe achten er fÃ¤llte sehr groÃ\\x9f aus, besser eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer kaufen, Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn\\'t cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn\\'t help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, \"Large Toebox\" and \"Great for wide feet\". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don\\'t feel boxy and like I\\'m wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It\\'s only been one hike, but I love them so far and don\\'t see any issues coming up in the future. The threads are showing on both toe covers in under 100 miles.  I\\'ve been walking everyday in these shoes for just under 4 weeks, which I average about 3 to 4 miles per day.  I probably have about 80 - 90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposure.I\\'m filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goes.As for the fit, I initially struggled with trying to like these, as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells.  I\\'m an 11W, and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit, but I\\'ve been satisfied with comfort after the first day.The first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful.  One foot felt off centered, the other ankle lace was digging into my skin.  However, after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again, I\\'ve been happy every since.  So, don\\'t be completely discouraged by first impressions, it may just take a little adjusting. First I want to say that I am a woman and I buy men\\'s shoes to get the width I need.  I have a neuroma in one foot and a fibroma in the other, along with high arches.  I need very wide shoes and lots of cushioning.  I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time, and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me, so the others were returned.  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths, and Moab Edge 2.  I wear a size 8 to 8.5 in women\\'s shoes, mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs.  In a men\\'s shoe I go down 1 to 1.5 sizes.  In this shoe a men\\'s 7 wide was perfect.  No, you won\\'t get the Vibram sole, but comfort was more important to me than the sole material. Total disappointment; you certainly don\\'t get what you pay for ($80.00) with these.  Merrell is supposed to be a good name with a good reputation for quality shoes, but unfortunately it hasn\\'t been my experience with the last to pairs of hiking shoes I\\'ve purchased of theirs.I had these barely 4 months and both heels already had holes worn through the sole.  See attached pics.  Merrell minimizing material costs by reducing the thickness of the sole is just unacceptable for an $80.00 shoe.I certainly won\\'t be purchasing Merrell any longer....Columbia are on my radar now. Delivery was on time and no damages. As with all the other Merrell footwear I have purchased, these shoes are of the quality I expect from them. This is first time I have ordered Merrell products on Amazon, so not sure if that is the reason for my issue. I order 10.5 US from Merrell for all my hiking and general purpose shoes, but these seem about half an inch shorter in length than all my other 10.5 Merrell shoes. And I found out that Merrell lowered their price of this shoe to $80 - so I did not save any money by buying from Amazon! Lesson learned! I will NOT be purchasing footwear from Amazon in the future. I paid the same on Amazon as Merrell\\'s website, and the fit is not the same as I expect. Tried to save a few dollars and screwed myself. I have had a pair of Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes that I use almost daily for my walking regiment and I have also used them twice walking sections of the Appalacian Trial and they have worn like iron. The only place they have shown much wear is the back of the shoe at the heel. I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they don\\'t look too bad for \"old hiking shoes\" but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just aren\\'t \"pristine\" looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics, parties, and eating out with my wife. I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them. So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes. The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 1.5 to 2 mile daily walks with them. It\\'s like they were already \"broken-in\" and I don\\'t get any blisters or sore areas on my feet or heels from using them new right out of the box. Updating my review (below) after I\\'ve been wearing these shoes for about two weeks.In addition to being smaller than the actual size and too narrow, they do not have much cushioning, which causes some heel pain after a long walk. I would return them but my guess it is too late.Previous review:These are indeed fine-looking shoes, comfortable and cushy. Hopefully, they will serve me well.On the downside, they are not exactly true to size: size 11 actually feels like 10.5. Also, they are moderately uneven: left shoe looks somewhat narrower and slightly curved toward the inside. From my personal experience these don\\'t even come close to moabs. Tried them hoping to get a good pair of Merrills for less then what I was used to spending.  I regret the decision. While they fit well enough, and have plenty of space. They don\\'t provide the same support. 2 months in and my feet hurt walking in them for extended periods of time. It took my last pair of moabs well over a year to get to this point.  Unfortunately I\\'ll end up buying a new pair of shoes much sooner then expected because I tried to save a few bucks. I ordered these in a wide since I\\'ve been having issues with other shoe manufacturers being too small and tight but I could have gotten by with the standard width. I will continue to by Merrell shoes since they last forever and their shoe size fits as expected. Ho acquistato queste scarpe per la nuova stagione, avendo giÃ\\xa0 avuto altre Mizuno nelle stagioni precedenti, e le sto usando da settembre. La scarpa Ã¨ esteticamente bella, ed Ã¨ molto comoda. Le prime volte che si indossano risultano molto fascianti, quasi strette, ma dopo qualche giorno di utilizzo si lasciano andare, senza perÃ² diventare larghe. Offrono un\\'ottima stabilitÃ\\xa0 e ammortizzazione.Peccato perÃ² che dopo qualche mese di utilizzo si siano giÃ\\xa0 rovinate parecchio... arrivate oggi e provate stasera in campo. vestibilitÃ\\xa0: a primo impatto sembra stretta ma giÃ\\xa0  dopo il primo set la scarpa prende la  forma del piede. gradita sorpresa il livello di ammortizzazione della suola: ho problemi alle ginocchia e queste scarpe mi hanno aiutato parecchio. tengono fermo il piede rimanendo leggere, ottima risposta negli spostamenti in campo. Arrivate con un giorno di ritardo, ma avvertito della cosa.Prodotto corrispondente alla descrizione, di ottima fattura e molto stabili e comode.

Comodissimi Ã¨ di ottima qualitÃ Just to say excellent thanks I sandaletti sono comodi Ã¨ abbastanza facili da indossare perÃ² bisogna fare attenzione alle taglie che non sono proprio bilanciate il rischio Ã¨ che siano piccole 24/25 o un poâ\\x80\\x99 grandi 26/27 . Io ho optato per un poâ\\x80\\x99 grandi e penso che le utilizzerÃ² anche lâ\\x80\\x99anno prossimo. Le scarpe sono morbide e leggere. Unica cosa che il materiale le pizzica la pelle dopo un pÃ³.

Ricevuto con i tempi concordati.Il prodotto lo conoscevo, perchÃ¨ giÃ\\xa0 acquistato.Ottima qualitÃ\\xa0, identico al precedente. Arrivo puntualissimo. La scarpa calzava perfettamente. Belle e comode The shies are very nice and comfertable as well its great for the spring tume and summer of course id recommend you buy them i bought every color I\\'m already 6ft but I was curious how this works.  I figure women can automatically grow 3 inches taller with high heels, why can\\'t guys try it?Well it did work with the height jump.  It\\'s amazing feeling walking in a public place and all of the sudden looking down more on people\\'s heads.  The only downside it they begin to hurt your feet after an hour or so.  It\\'s not horrible and maybe that\\'s what women deal w/ via high heels.  But if there was a way around this it would be nice. Purchased these shoes for my Fiance to wear at our wedding in hopes it would give a little more height in our pictures.  We love them.  They look better in person!  My Fiance said they fit very comfy.  I guess the true test will be on our wedding day but so far everything looks great!! Walking in them feels absolutely terrible. Like walking in loose heels or something. Perhaps feels better if they fit. Too tight. Great shoe, high quality. The extra height adds confidence. I was shocked of the quality, perfection in every way, they are very comfortable, a little loud when walking on hard Floors but other than that they are amazing. Nice elevation and style but toe area is tight and it hurts after a while Me agrado el estilo, la elegancia y el Material de confecciÃ³n It\\'s a little to moderately tight across the toe area! El precio es genial. La marca es de mucha calidad por lo que la oferta es lo que me convenciÃ³ para la compra Top class product. High quality. Original. Perfect fit. Very comfortable. Nice colour. Bought for my wife. She is liking it a lot. Shoes fit well with socks. Comfortable and great for long brisk walk or run.Foot width matches perfectly. No soreness felt in either foot . Great product .Worth the money and meets expectations. Da menos talla y de la punta es muy cerrado Not fit for sports person.it fales side when we run. Prima Es muy cerrado y duro en el empeine; si es como la foto pero lo comprÃ© un poco mÃ¡s grande para que no me molestara en la parte trasera del pies y al caminar me saco ampolla Trotz gleicher SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe und scheinbar gleichem Nachfolgeprodukt des Nike Shield Zoom Winflo 4 ist der Schuh viel zu klein ausgefallen. Versand, Zustellung und RÃ¼cknahme waren in Ordnung. Perfect shoes for Running!! Wrong description by Amazon. It is not size 4.5 UK, but 4UK. This pair of shoes is amazing.  My first good pair of running shoes since i started running last year.  This size fits me perfectly and I have an average width foot for a lady. I also have a high arch and these support me well. No foot pain on my walk/ run with these shoes.  I haven\\'t tested out the water resistance on them yet because they look too good to get dirty.  Would definitely recommend this shoe. Die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt wie erwartet - hier entspricht die 38 auch einer 38. Ich habe vorn einen recht breiten FuÃ\\x9f und die Schuhe bieten genug Platz ohne zu drÃ¼cken. Die Verarbeitung ist gut und ich finde sie lassen sich vielseitig zu Hosen, Leggings und Kleidern kombinieren. Pies tal cual en la fotografÃ\\xada, es un diseÃ±o bonito y cÃ³modo. Para quiÃ©nes busquen un pie de gato confortable con una suela plana. Los recomiendo tanto para iniciaciÃ³n como niveles intermedios. Para vÃ\\xadas mÃ¡s agresivas segÃºn gustos me irÃ\\xada a una forma asimÃ©trica. Pies de gato indicados para pies con forma egipcia. Buen soporte en el talÃ³n, buen ajuste gracias a los cordones y aÃ±adir que es un pie de gato con horma estrecha, por lo que a mi concretamente me han encajado a la perfecciÃ³n para mis pies estrechos.Como recomendaciÃ³n para iniciaciÃ³n comprar vuestra talla que solÃ©is utilizar en calzado normal sino estÃ¡is habituados a llevar el pie apretado, una mÃ¡s en un par de meses notarÃ©is el pie demasiado flojo y os darÃ¡ desconfianza. Son de piel y estiran.Para orientaros porque no encontraba tabla exacta con cms yo pedÃ\\xad 3 tallas diferentes para comparar y ver quÃ© necesitaba la 36 2/3 son 23cm, 37 1/3 son 23,5 y la 38 son 23,7.Espero que os sirva de ayuda y referencia. Son los primeros pies de gato que tengo. Los he utilizado para Boulder y muy bien.Primeramente pedi 37 1/3 ya que suelo calzar un 37, pero tuve que cambiarlos por un nÃºmero mÃ¡s, el 38 perfectos. Es ist ein guter AnfÃ¤ngerschuh, guter Grip, fÃ¼r Kletterschuhe sehr bequem, durch SchnÃ¼rsenkel perfekt fÃ¼r schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe. Bei einem Gebrauch von 1x die Woche hat sich nach ca. 3 Monaten leider an einigen Stellen die Sohle gelÃ¶st, jetzt nach 5 Monaten kann ich ihn ausrangieren, weil sich die Sohle an den Seiten komplett schÃ¤lt. HabÃ\\xada oÃ\\xaddo que esta marca de zapatos es comodÃ\\xadsima y lo confirmo. Ideas para ir tanto con pantalones como con vestido o falda. Muy bonitas y modernas. Quedan genial puestas, y muy cÃ³modas.PensÃ© que por el estampado no iban a combinar mucho, pero me las pongo tanto con vaquero azul, como con gris o negro.Estoy encantada. Al principio un poco rÃ\\xadgidas.. las primeras veces, te van a molestar, pero luego, comodÃ\\xadsimas y preciosas. Â¡Viva la originalidad! Me ha encantado el diseÃ±o y estaban a buen precio. Estoy encantada.  Las habÃ\\xada visten tienda mÃ¡s caras Son muy bonitas como en la foto When I ordered this sneakers I checked the sizes. My size is 6 and in the size chart it says size 4 UK is size 6 so I clicked that. When it arrived I saw it\\'s size 7. I had this delivered in my friend\\'s place in USA because I lived in the Philippines. My friend brought it today. I love everything the style, color except that it\\'s not my size. My colleagues suggested to just wear 2 socks because it\\'s really nioce on me and it fits my personality! Is it possible to have it changed? Please let me know.... Ich habe inzwischen 150km im Hyperion Tempo absolviert. Vom 7km Fartlek, 10km Tempoeinheit und dem HM in 75% Pace - der Hyperion Tempo macht eine super Figur. Das Zusammenspiel von DÃ¤mpfung, Direktheit und Leichtigkeit ist aus meiner Sicht hervorragend. Doch der Reihe nach:Gewicht: Der Schuh ist nicht nur leicht, er fÃ¼hlt sich auch genauso an und lÃ¤uft sich, besonders bei schnellen km sehr gut. Die Mittelsohle ist nicht zu schmal aber das DNA Loft Material ist super und bietet ausreichend DÃ¤mpfung was nicht zu lasten des Gewichts geht.DÃ¤mpfung: FÃ¼r reine VersenlÃ¤ufer ist der Schuh sicher nicht die beste Wahl, fÃ¼r MittelfuÃ\\x9flÃ¤ufer ist er meiner Meinung nach super. Die DÃ¤mpfung ist ausreichend, man spÃ¼rt die EnergierÃ¼ckgewinnung, wenn auch nicht so sehr wie bei einem Carbon-Schuh (kostet auch wesentlich weniger).Feedback: Die Sohle ist zwar nicht sehr dÃ¼nn, aber sie gibt viel Feedback. So ist der Lauf auf sehr groben Schotterwegen eher gewÃ¶hnungsbedÃ¼rftig. Auf Trailabschnitten sowie dem Asphalt spielt der Hyperion Tempo seine StÃ¤rken aus. Die Sohle ist sehr haltbar und nach den 150km ist noch kaum Verschleiss an der AuÃ\\x9fensohle zu sehen.Die SchnÃ¼rsenkel sind sehr dÃ¼nn und dÃ¼rften etwas kÃ¼rzer sein, selbst mit Runners Knot sind sie meiner Auffassung nach noch einen Tick zu lange.Alles in allem ein hervorragender schuh von Brooks - mit dem sich bei jedem Wetter laufen lÃ¤sst und man lange (+650km) SpaÃ\\x9f haben kann.Sofern die Rezension hilfreich war, freue ich mich Ã¼ber ein Daumen nach oben ;-) Scarpe molto belle e leggere.Stringhe un pochino lunghe. Pour la course sur route , bitume, et chemin sans cailloux, pas faite pour le trail ou chemin caillouteux.taille un peu petit, je l\\'ai porterai pour mon premier marathon Paris 17 octobre 2021. These shoes work better the faster I go. Mercury\\'s wings on my feet. Best way to describe the feeling is with each step, it\\'s like a little hand tapping up from the ground into my foot. Sounds crazy but the technology is there. Light weight, Hyperion tempo felt great even after a 10 mile race. I left them on afterwards and did not feel any discomfort. This shoe is made for competitive running and would not recommend training in them, but you can. Light, soft but responsive cushion, comfortable, stretchy uppers, laces that flex.  These are a dream.In the words of Drake, â\\x80\\x9cYou the best Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever had.â\\x80\\x9d Gift for son-in-law and he says the fit is great You feel very quick in these shoes. Not for the beginner if training for distance running. Overall very well made. Will definitely recommend. I am so glad I discovered the yellow box flip flops. Not only do they look and fit great but they also offer great cushion when walking and as I suffer from plantar fasciitis it is extremely helpful. I ordered two more of a different designs as soon as I received these and walked around in them for a couple of days. They are worth every penny and most likely I\\'ll never buy another brand again. I definitely recommend this product I love everything about these flip flops!  No pain between toes.  Cushiony foot bed. These are amazing!  So comfortable!  Gives you a spring in your step!  Best of all the piece between your toes does not hurt! Very comfortable and beautiful Comfortable, cushiony sole. Soft fabric between toe band suitable for sensitive toes or toes tightly together. Absolutely love these flip flops. After receiving my initial order I placed a second order of two more colours. They were suppose to be denim and they are plastic A little pricey for foam flip flops , but very nice and extremely comfortable. I am happy with them. Love these so comfy worth the buy for sure Je les adore. La grandeur est bonne, elles sont confortables. They are very nice shoes and I was super excited to get these shoes as I absolutely need new shoes but I was pretty upset when I tried to get my feet into them and there was just no way I could the material is not stretchy like my last pair of pumas ð\\x9f\\x98\\x94 so definitely make sure you have very slender feet before purchasing these. As described, unique look. Very comfortable. Worn them a few times, even shopping for at least 2 hrs. Love that there are no laces. Just slip them on and off I love them so much Iâ\\x80\\x99m a nurse and they keep my feet comfortable These shoes are great if you work on your feet! Its fit comfortable  very soft and nice Amazing! Love it! I like these shoes as a health care worker who is on my feet for 60 hours a week,  it\\'s all about comfort.  Stepping into these is like stepping into a pillow.  They are remarkably soft and easy on my feet. Puma, like Fila (the designer I wear) run tight across the foot and toe area, always for me. This shoe however runs tight across the top of the shoe. Itâ\\x80\\x99s how the shoe is sewn under the stretch band. I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the sock shoe or boot shoe or whatever that shoe is called that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have laces and you have to wrestle with your foot to try and put them in. But these shoes I made an exception because of the style, I love it. Very uncomfortable, at first but now after several wears and washes, the shoes seem to be more tolerable. I get a lot of compliments on these shoes. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a 10 but Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I got the 10.5, I know it made a difference in the fit...great. Too bad the bottom of the shoe wasnâ\\x80\\x99t speckled in gold like the first Puma Prowl but itâ\\x80\\x99s a comfortable nice shoe just the same ;) I have a white pair of Puma slip on sneakers and I love them but I wore them camping stupidly and they got ruined. So I\\'ve been on the hunt for a new pair and I came across these. I liked that the style was similar to what I already have and I liked that the sliver straps were sparkly. Totally up my alley. They look exactly as shown. They shipped pretty much right away. It didn\\'t take long to receive them. When I got them I tried them on and the \"fit\" but unfortunately even though I ordered these in my size the material that they are made with probably wasn\\'t the greatest choice because I can see the outline of my foot with the shoe on. I can see my toes very easily. So I can imagine if I were to wear them out and about people are going to be able to see the shape of my foot and my toes move while walking. It looks very odd. They are comfortable, the material is comfortable but not a good choice. Probably for anyone. Very lightweight too. I will be returning them and continue to look for another pair. I really like them. They get a little uncomfortable after a while,but I guess the elastic will need time to stretch. See DanGeorge review it is accurate .... plus after 2days of wearing the Reebok printed label started wear off! The sole of the shoe is so thin you can feel a pebble ...... very unhappy with the supplier and with Amazon for promoting this garbage!!!!!!  And now I am out almost $130.00.  THANK YOU AMAZON!Follow-Up 05/28/21 Went to the Reebok Outlook Mall Store they told me this shoe model # is not one of theirs shoes.....I tried to make them work for a week.  They were so uncomfortable to wear I bought insoles to try to make them comfortable didn\\'t work....after 1 day of wearing the shoes the Reebok logo printd inside the shoe was wearing away.......oh! While I was at the Reebok Store I purchased a great pair of Reebok\\'s, very very comfortable and for only $73.00 Bought these in January, in April, the leather on the right shoe started to bubble. In May the left shoe outer seam ripped. I\\'m not doing any real activity in these, just walking - I think around 5k steps a day. This isn\\'t the quality I remember from Reebok. Bought for my son for work as he is on his feet all day. Great so far El producto es de piel sintÃ©tica por lo que carece de la calidad esperada. Por favor no lo publiquen asÃ\\xad porque engaÃ±an al cliente y lo hacen dudar o convencerse de que la prÃ³xima compra volverÃ¡ a ser engaÃ±ado. Good thing Very sturdy but comfortable shoe. I have worn them for a full day on several occasions with total comfort. Incredibly comfortable and stylish. Great shoes! ã\\x81¯ã\\x81\\x91ã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x93ã\\x81¨ã\\x81¯ã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x8cï¼\\x8cï¼µï¼³ã\\x82µã\\x82¤ã\\x82ºã\\x81¨å\\x9fºæº\\x96ã\\x81\\x8cé\\x81\\x95ã\\x81\\x86ã\\x82\\x88ã\\x81\\x86ã\\x81\\xa0ã\\x80\\x82 I read reviews to help in purchase decisions. So I hope this review helps you. In a shoe store using gauge I have a men\\'s 10-1/2 D (regular width foot) actual size.  I buy size 11- Wide in everything I buy,Skechers,work boots etc.I like to ensure room for expansion and insert foot beds if needed. I bought sof sole gel insoles here on Amazon also.These arrived today, I ordered 11 X-W  They showed on order as 11 4E {?} Length is good,width is slightly snug with or without replacement insoles. If you truly have a wide foot,good luck. Otherwise the insoles are tacky stuck down but are removable,inserts make a big difference. Quality is good,bright white,look nice and yes I would recommend These are fire I love them! I was scared when ordering these because theyâ\\x80\\x99re so cheap - less than $30 I thought they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be authentic or made out of plastic. These are authentic, the box was in good condition all labels were on. They feel great when I put them on and I donâ\\x80\\x99t see any signs of them being fake. Even have memory foam type material at the bottom feels good. I have been looking for some nice casual white leather shoes and these slap! I get mad compliments. Iâ\\x80\\x99m buying all these colors and will post the results. I would say that they are slightlyyyy narrow just a little. So if you have fat feet that may effect you. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t let that effect the rating cause I donâ\\x80\\x99t have that problem. Ima do some walking in them if they hurt my feet or somethin Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let yâ\\x80\\x99all know. Delivery was quick as promised. The product is the same as the one at the store for half the cost. Appears to be of the same quality. Cant say anything about the durability at this time. Fits perfectly and kids love it. Thank you. Now to find a pair for myself. I have a tough time sizing my kid\\'s cleats because the shoes mostly run narrow.  Our soccer also go back and forth between turf and grass during the season, and my kid doesn\\'t like traditional cleats (notably on harder surfaces).  He also usually blows out his shoes during a season.  This shoe gets 5 stars for lasting a season and for fitting on a little wider foot.  The grip from the shorter cleats also work well for a kid on grass (even a bigger one like mine).  Buying the adult version this year for baseball (same issue with spiky cleats, especially using artificial pitching mounds) and soccer as he has grown out of the kid size. These are visibly way too narrow. Too narrow for the average human foot. My kid only wore them once. He said they hurt. I shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve returned them. My daughter loves it. She is 7 and plays indoor soccer on turf. She said the shoes are comfy and flexible. I will be being the cleata version of these for the spring season. El producto sugiere que es talla de niÃ±os pero cuando abrÃ\\xad el paquete es talla de hombres! entonces mi zapato es mucho mas grande de lo que esperaba. el tono no es el mimo de la foto en la foto se ve blanco y rosado. En realidad es un tono medio brilloso blanco y un tipo anaranjadoen vez del rosa. No puedo devolver porq lo pedi por Encargo hasta ECUADOR pÃ©simo NO COMPREN CON ESTE VENDEDOR!! My daughter loves these shoes. They are comfortable for her and she likes the color pattern. I am planning on getting a bigger size later on. Was a little bit bigger than expected but still nice and comfortable Very nice Very nice and comfortable shoes my son liked them he plays soccer with them and runs great he says they are perfect Daughter wire these to the field right out of the box. Comfortable. Fits well. Well made Used for over a year and still in great shape. Even the laces are in good shape. Very durable! great sport shoe. good looking , great quality. perfect fit. The shoe has held up relatively well. The shoes are lightweight and material is pretty tough. I give three out of five stars because of the toe - better reinforcement of the toes considering little boys play hard (soccer during recess) and the toes of shoes need to hold up more than two weeks to soccer ball kicks. My daughter loves the color light pink with the grey fits well looks great. Super cute but too narrow. my son loves it Perfect Great These shoes are great, I had been looking for a pair of shoes that fit my feet and were comfortable for months, I had been everywhere I could think of to try and find a pair, even went to store to try shoes on all with no luck. Then I found these shoes, they fit great, it will be the first pair of shoes in years that don\\'t break open on the sides for me and on top of that I was able to wear them right out of the box day 1 and they were comfortable. I\\'m on my feet a good amount of the day and wear these shoes for 12-14 hours a day and at the end of the day my feet don\\'t hurt and I have noticed less back and leg pain since wearing these shoes. I liked them so much I turned around and purchased a 2nd pair in a different color and those are just as amazing. I would highly recommend these shoes. I have owned many different pairs of the ASICS Gel-Nimbus Shoes over the years and have never been disappointed with the feel, performance and look of these shoes! Can\\'t beat the price that I purchased this new ASICS Men\\'s Gel-Nimbus 21 Running Shoes at! Very Happy! Got here fast. Nice and comfortable shoe, I wear a 9.5 and they fit perfectly. Thanks! Good running sneaker They are soooo comfortable and stable! Forget about Nike! I strongly recommend ASICS. Iâ\\x80\\x99m very satisfied with the purchase. Was delivered fast. Super cool Christmas gift for my son the runner This was a gift for someone. I\\'ve had a lot of Romas over time. They are great. But be sure to get a half a size larger than usual. I love the color and how it fits on my 3 year old son. Would be purchasing another puma Roma. I delivery was faster than I expected. Love loving this shoes ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 Loving these shoes just as image My son loves this sneakers It is good to know that if there were to be a problem that I could easily return.  With that being said all went well and they fit exactly as expected.  They were suppose to be for school but we had to try them out.  Perfect My son loves this sneakers , he is wearing it all day long It was a great fit Fast delivery from USA. Quality product. Se va el color al par de semanas Sehr schÃ¶n leichter Schuh fÃ¼r den Sommer, mein Sohn liebt Sie Ã¼ber allesð\\x9f\\x91\\x8dð\\x9f\\x8f» SchÃ¶ne Schuhe die lange halten. Bei anderen geht oft die Sohle ab. Passt wie erwartet. Mein Sohn liebt die Schuhe All well but the size is small than it should Unser Sohn hat sich sofort damit wohl gefÃ¼hlt. Kaufempfhelung. GUtes Material. nachdem die Schule bei uns am Montag wieder Ã¶ffnet mussten schnell neue Hausschuhe her da mein Sohn aus seinen bisher genutzten herausgewachsen ist.Wichtig war mir vor Allem das der neue Hausschuh atmungsaktiv ist damit die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe nicht so schwitzen.Mit den Kinder Clogs bin ich diesbezÃ¼glich auch zufrieden. Sie sind leicht und luftig und mein Sohn mag sie auch. Die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt gut und die Verarbeitung ist auch ordentlich.Empfehlenswert. Die Schuhe sind Super, sie passen sehr gut. Wir haben sie fÃ¼r den Garten gekauft. Mein Sohn mag sie gern und findet die Schuhe bequem. Ich wÃ¼rde sie wieder kaufen in der nÃ¤chsten Saison. Es ist ein gutes Produkt, aber nicht beeindruckend, daher bewerte ich es mit drei Sternen Nett, aber nach einem Monat Riemen bei beiden Kindern abgerissen. Tutto ok j\\'aime , on est bien dedans , ils sont lÃ©gers et souples Excelente calidad de materiales. Ligeros y cÃ³modos Just the summer cricket shoe for which I have been searching. The fit is accurate, the shoe is the most comfortable in my wardrobe. I do not hesitate to recommend this product. The shoes appear well made; thye are of a quality that one expects. I like it... Nice looking, comfortable, and very light. They are used for playing the pedals on the organ! The best tap shoes. I\\'m a french tap teacher and thanks to amazon.com, I purchased professional tap shoes, that I used to buy an amazing price (250 $), for a very small price. The delivery was very fast and the product perfect. As I have a very good cobbler for the build up, I have now professional tap shoes for half price. Thank you amazon.com, I will be a returned customer.P.S. for capezio tap shoes, you have to know your perfect size before ordering. el producto esta buen estado y llego a venezuela como se ve en la foto referencial gracia buen vendedor lo felicito I think there is a big problem with the way this shoe is sized. I am not convinced that this shoe can be fit to a woman\\'s foot.I ordered and tried 3 different sized pairs. The last one that I decided to keep and wear caused me very large and painful heel blisters after 20 minutes of dancing. Of course now that they are used I cannot return. $300. loss.I think you would do better with a cheaper shoe. My Blochs never caused these problems. The shoes that were in the box were the wrong size a 13 1/2 not 12 as stated in the ad. Lammfell innen, echtes Leder auÃ\\x9fen, wasserfest und sieht auch noch toll aus. Meine Tochter liebt diese Stiefel. Die Schuhe sind zwar leider nicht sooooo weich /zu knicken wie unsere Sommerschuhe, aber fÃ¼r Herbst/winterstiefel sind sie perfekt. Robust und trotzdem schick This shoe looks good but doesn\\'t feel good! They made a sore ð\\x9f\\x98© on my heel! I\\'m sticking with adidas! It is comfortable and nice, a good buy The back of the shoe is high and rubs blisters.... Sehr bequemer und schÃ¶ner Schuh.Ich schwanke immer zwischen 38 und 39. Hier hat mir 39 gepasst. Buen articulo, esta marca me va bien Be careful-- there is no realistic return policy, I like in FL and they want $100 to return The shoes I received are not the same shoes pictured. The shoes pictured had a velcro strap closure. The shoes I received appear to have the same lower body, however they have  lace closures. Disappointing! Sooouu...4 month old shoes. Cute, bright, fit as expected. I\\'ve owned new balance before and have always been happy with the brand. These did not hold up. My daughter barely wore them because she has many shoes. I just now realized how worn they look. In these 4 months these shoes have never been washed or cleaned (demonstrating they truly are still new) and you can see the soles are barely worn but very torn and worn on the fabric side. Pictures attached for you to use your own judgement. En asfalto se comportan como un guante. These are fantastic shoes for my seven year old.  He loves them.  We ordered the white ones, which turned out having pink-lavenderish-\"N\"s on them.  I pulled out a black Sharpie and changed that before my son saw.  Lol.  These plastic toggles on the laces have not held up.  One is completely gone already, with another hanging by a thread.  Not sure why.  Great grip.  Easy to wipe clean. I purchased these for my daughter who wears a 2.5. They arrived today and she had the hardest time putting them on. When I tried I did as well but succeeded. She said they were way too tight and hurt her foot. As far as appearance, they are nice looking but you may need to order half a size up or even wide for your kiddo (we never had to buy wide for her shoes). Fit as expected, however these have shown wear rather quickly. They do not tighten around my daughterâ\\x80\\x99s ankles well so they rub together throughout the day as they are sticking out a bit. She says then are comfortable shoes- they just didnâ\\x80\\x99t stay looking nice as long as I expected. She started wearing these late August- so this is less than 4 months of wear. My son has wide feet and normally has a least half an inch of toe room in a size 11. However, these shoes fit just right. I bought a wide and the shoe was snug on his foot as well with thin socks. I am returning for a larger size since I love the quality. Pictures do not do it justice! Buy the shoe but go for a larger size and XW if your child has a wide foot. My son is kind of particular about how his shoes look. But I picked these out without him and he loved them. The basic color is great since he wears them every day. He says they\\'re comfortable. I bought them a little big for him to grow into, but they still work well for him. So far the quality is good. We\\'ll see in a few more months, but I have high hopes. I got these for my 5 & 1/2 year old, so take that into consideration when he says they are the best shoes heâ\\x80\\x99s ever worn ð\\x9f\\x98\\x84I like the fact that I could get a pair of classic trainers for him in extra wide. 3rd paid of NBs for him and will continue to do so. We bought these for my elementary son to run cross country.  They are well made, but do not offer as much support as some of the other options out there.  They will serve our purposes for this season, but I will likely choose something with more support next time. I bought this for my boy, and they came to large. On top of that its described as girls shoes , and I donâ\\x80\\x99t  Find them very girly Decent looking UNISEX shoes that I hope my son will wear in near future Scarpe super comode e ancora piÃ¹ belle che da foto. Al tatto il leopardato sembra pelo vero ! Sono super contenta del mio acquisto. Ho preso un 40 e calza perfettamente. Le adoro, comode e chic con un tocco di stravaganza! Belle ma calzano pochissimo Los zapatos me han gustado y me queda genial. Son elegantes y cÃ³modos .

El nÃºmero perfecto. Quedan muy y son comodisimas. Las recomiendo y el precio, mejor que en tienda It fits as expected but it is very tight and I did not find a way to loosen the shoe laces. Camper! Toujours aussi agrÃ©able Ã\\xa0 porter, et toujours le Style !!!Camper forever ! fit my duck shaped feeta bit tight across the toes but they will break in They are so cute and very comfortable. Perfect warm waterproof boot for kids in the snow The liner to the boot runs VERY SMALL. My toddler is a size 5, I ordered a 6, and the boot is big but the liner is tiny and very narrow. The width of the liner is seriously that of a newborn shoe. Itâ\\x80\\x99s that narrow and small. Her foot WILL NOT fit into it. Forget trying to put a foot with socks on it into the boot. Iâ\\x80\\x99m seriously debating on returning these if the liner is unusable and the boots wonâ\\x80\\x99t keep her feet warm without it. Without the liner itâ\\x80\\x99s essentially a fancy rainboot, there is zero integrated padding/warmth into the boot. å\\x88\\x9dã\\x82\\x81ã\\x81¦ã\\x81®ã\\x82ªã\\x83\\x8bã\\x83\\x84ã\\x82«ã\\x82¿ã\\x82¤ã\\x82¬ã\\x83¼ã\\x81®ã\\x82¹ã\\x83\\x8bã\\x83¼ã\\x82«ã\\x83¼ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x81\\x8cã\\x80\\x81ä»\\x8aã\\x81®ã\\x81¨ã\\x81\\x93ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x81\\x86ï¼\\x91è¶³æ¬²ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81ª My son is 22 months and the liner was WAY too narrow for his foot!!  Even taking the liner out and trying to get just that on him before trying the boot on, I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t able to get his toes past the middle of the liner.  It was quite literally HALF the width of his wide, little baby foot!  They were also very heavy and clunky, so if we could have gotten them on, I imagine they would have been difficult for him to walk in. While I\\'m sure these are warm & I love Columbia, these boots are much too clumpy for a toddler. My one year old loves to walk & run, but in these boots she can hardly lift her feet, so insists on being carried, even when just testing them in the house. Might be fine for an older child, but I would go with Land\\'s End in that case, anyway. I really wanted these boots to work! So much so that I ignored the other reviews and tried them anyway. The inside liner is not just small, but bunches up making it impossible to get a foot into them. In addition to that the shaft is so stiff it makes it challenging to get it past the ankle. I love everything Columbia, and theyâ\\x80\\x99re a trusted brand, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m so super bummed by these! Probably great but too hard to get on their feet. After about the third time I just didnt want to do it again so they just sat there. I got the kamiks and they slip right on perfect fit. These fit well but you almost have to break your kids leg to get them in them. The liner in this boot is just cheap foam. Does not even seem like it will keep a childâ\\x80\\x99s feet warm. My son is a toddler size 5, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what was purchased. I cannot even get his foot down into the boot because they are so tight even at the ankle. My son loves these! They are very good quality. I never have a problem with any Columbia product that I purchase. These boots are great. They fit as expected and they are sturdy. They have held up to little boy ruff and tuff play. No matter how long they have been out or how wet the snow has been their feet come out dry. There has even been some complaints of hot feet. Which is a great thing in my book. Great quality. Sturdy boots. My son can DESTROY any pair of boots or shoes in a week... he has many many times! But these have held up well to the abuse they take on a daily basis! Never hear conplaints about cold piggies! This is a well built, lightweight waterproof shoe. I\\'m a size 13, and it feels just a tad bit small. These shoes took a long while to break in, to the point where I almost gave up on them, which would have been a shame considering the price. About a month in, wearing them once a day for a walk, I\\'m at the point where I feel they are a good, quality walking shoe now that they\\'re broken in. So far they\\'ve kept water out during light rain and small puddles. Great Son muy buenos y sÃºper cÃ³modos son una belleza ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 Muy buen articulo Muy lindos y sÃºper cÃ³modos,a mi esposa le encantaron Muy cÃ³modos First off, I had no problems with the seller or shipping. The problem with these shoes was that the toes have an angular design that caused my toes to get uncomfortably squeezed, and they seem to run small too. The angle didn\\'t look too sharp in the picture but it definitely feels too sharp. This was my first time trying women\\'s puma shoes do I didnâ\\x80\\x99t really know what to expect and had to return these. My 11 year old granddaughter loves these sneakers. They are stylish and Puma makes great athletic shoes. I bought two pairs. Just as comfy as I was hoping theyâ\\x80\\x99d be and they look great! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten compliments from guys and girls. I like the color schemes , cushions in soles They fit just right and look really nice Shoes was dirty and it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t what I was expected. Also it looks as though it was wore before and partially cleaned up with white shoe polish added. I am very disappointed! EstÃ¡n muy bonitos pero si me gustarÃ\\xada que tuvieran mÃ¡s memory fom. Pero de allÃ\\xad estan muy bien. Muchas gracias. Sobre todo por quÃ© soy una persona que tengo cancer y no he encontrados zapatos cÃ³modos cerrados que me ayuden pues mis pies se fisuran la piel es muy delgada por eso me han gustado mucho la marca sketchers pues me acomodan muy bien a mis pies. Muchas gracias.

They\\'re my favourite shoes and now they\\'re also her favourite shoes they fit great she\\'s able to walk better than usual.  I couldn\\'t ask for a better pair of shoes for her. I love these shoes.  I can wear them all day and my feet donâ\\x80\\x99t hurt at the end of the day! I have five pair now.  And I can throw them in the washing machine when they get dirty. I bought this shoe for my mother who is in assisted living. These shoes are the most comfortable Sketchers I have ever had...so, I bought myself some too! LOL Got these for my mom and she loves them, wears them everyday. Red shoes for a cause.  Great price, comfortable walking support, but narrow.  I wish they came in wide sizes. These shoes are super-comfortable and I\\'m so happy with the color! Skechers never disappoints me. Received my Skechers and they fit great Son muy cÃ³modos con la excelente calidad de Puma. Puestos se ven mejor que en las fotos.Solo que las tallas son 1/2 nÃºmero mayores Considerando los comentarios pedÃ\\xad talla 23.5 siendo 24 en la mayorÃ\\xada de mis zapatos pero me llegÃ³ 23 :(. Me quedan un poco justos pero siento que los puedo usar asÃ\\xad, pero definitivamente me hubieran quedado bien los 23.5.Fuera de eso me gustaron los tenis, son iguales a las imÃ¡genes y estÃ¡n muy bonitos. Son justo como la descripciÃ³n. Llegaron en perfecto estado. Som cÃ³modos y ligeros. Muy buen diseÃ±o. Recomendado. Muy bonitos y cÃ³modos, pero muy amplio, tuve q ponerle plantilla por q me quedo un poco grande. Muy cÃ³modos Muy buen producto excelente Ame los tenis son cÃ³modos y el diseÃ±o super cool, llegÃ³ un dÃ\\xada antes de lo esperado. People admired and loved the runners . And so do I. I love it Excelente calidad y precio This is a beautiful shoe but the toe box is narrow.  I wear a regular in most shoes but Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s seem to run narrow for me.  Well worth the money if you know how they fit. Great look and comfortable at the same time! Also light to walk for awhile. Nice shoe but...how has no one mentioned how small they are??? Son wears size 8. We ordered the 8, naturally. They were absurdly small. We sent them back, got 9â\\x80\\x99s. They too are crazy small. The Nike in the pic is a size 8, NB a size 9. The quality is great but these run VERY small! I wear a 5.5 in womenâ\\x80\\x99s but went with a 6. Tried them on and within a few seconds couldnâ\\x80\\x99t feel my toes because theyâ\\x80\\x99re so tight. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll need to go up to a 6.5 at least and that has never happened. These were too narrow and tight even when going up one full size. Impossible to get on since there is no tongue that opens up to put the fiitin easier.  We will be returning these.  Disappointed Light Runs a full size smaller than regular shoes. Scarpa molto comoda che non ha dato alcun problema a nostra figlia , nonostante il molto utilizzo. Buon materiale , esteticamente non mi hanno fatto impazzire . Sandali ben fatti e molto carini per lâ\\x80\\x99estate! Adatti anche a chi ha un piede  magrolino! Vestono piccolo quindi ho dovuto prendere la misura piÃ¹ grande. Ottimo, comodo ed elegante. Li ho usati per le mie bimbe che hanno fatto da damigelle al mio matrimonio! Super QualitÃ¤t.

Have held up really well, look good enough for loafers. PERFECT FIT, WORDS CANNOT EXPLAIN C Good shoes, good price, speedy delivery.  Keep up the good work! Tres bonne qualitÃ© Most comfortable shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever bought, wish there were more in my size. Very good quality! Great ! Been wearing this brand exclusively for 8+ years and I appreciate the comfort these shoes provide. The are sleek enough for formal meetings and casual enough for classroom teaching. I always look for the best price as Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s are expensive, which I why I got this pair - I usually get them at Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s. I wear these 5 days a week 10 hours a day and they last almost all year with only the sole wearing out. Note: I do maintain them weekly by cleaning and polishing which probably helps the lasting look and feel of the uppers. Not clarcks , it came in unsturctured brand boxEven clarcks not graved on shoes Used wardrobe to try on a few pairs of slip ons as I wear them for work. These are comfortable and fit just right. It was up between these or the hush puppies. Ultimately went with these to try and was not diappointed. Excellent quality. Beautiful shoe. Son preciosos pero tuve que devolverlos porque estaban grandes Dieser Stiefel wÃ¼rde sogar 1000% von mir bekommen. Ich habe gar nicht so viel erwartet, aufgrund des ausgesprochen gÃ¼nstigen Preises. Aber !!!! Er ist wunderschÃ¶n. Passt perfekt, ist robust und wirklich sehr zu empfehlen. Ich habe sehr schmale Waden und hÃ¤tte mir wahrscheinlich ein sondermaÃ\\x9f anfertigen lassen mÃ¼ssen, aber wer schlank ist und auch schmale Waden hat, wird sich Ã¼ber diesen Stiefel wirklich freuen . Dieser Reisstiefel sieht wirklich gut aus. Leider ist er an den Waden extrem schmal geschnitten. Ich habe diese Stiefel fÃ¼r meine 12jÃ¤hrige sehr schlanke Tochter bestellt. Selbst sie hat den Stiefel oben am Druckknopf nicht zu bekommen. Weil sie diese aber unbedingt wollte hat der Schumacher unseres Vertrauens den Druckknopf versetzt, so dass sie letztendlich rein passte. Sehr hoher Schaft, somit auch nicht passend fÃ¼r Kinder.Und leider viel zu klein. Ich bin 1.63 und wiege 57kg, also ganz normale Statur. Habe auch keine dicken Waden, dennoch habe ich die Stiefel gerade mal bis zur Achillessehne zu bekommen. Sie sehen wunderschÃ¶n aus, sind aber nur was fÃ¼r wirklich sehr schlanke Beine! Artikel geht zurÃ¼ck. Ein Schein fÃ¼r den Kostenlosen rÃ¼ckversandt lag bei. Versuche jetzt nochmal die Stiefel in der kurzen/weiten Variante Leider bin ich ziemlich enttÃ¤uscht. FÃ¼r kleinere Kids vielleicht ok. Das das nicht echtes Leder ist, war mir ja schon vorher klar, aber das sind einfach Gummistiefel ! Anders kann ich es leider nicht beschreiben. An sich sehen sie ganz gut aus, aber am FuÃ\\x9f, nein tut mir leid. Wenn man lÃ¤uft, sacken sie richtig ein. Unten breit und oben eng, dass der Knopf fast nicht zu ging. PS : Sind wie ich meine die gleichen wie die bei KrÃ¤mer fÃ¼r 80 â\\x82¬. Also kÃ¶nnt ihr gerne nochmal dort vorbei gucken, so wie auf dem Bild hier sehen sie nÃ¤mlich eher nicht aus. Schade ! J\\'ai achetÃ© ces bottes dÃ©but d\\'annÃ©e et je pratique l\\'Ã©quitation de maniÃ¨re intensive (3 Ã\\xa0 5 fois par semaine) et je les mets lorsque je veux nettoyer les boxes, c\\'est-Ã\\xa0-dire tous les jours. Elles rÃ©sistent bien d\\'autant plus que je ne les soigne pas non plus Ã\\xa0 chaque fois car je les utilise en tant que bottes de travail. Elles sont assez confortables cependant la tirette bloque lÃ©gÃ¨rement au dÃ©but mais cela s\\'amÃ©liore avec son utilisation au fil du temps. Il faut lui laisser le temps de se former Ã\\xa0 votre pied.Je suis ravie d\\'avoir trouvÃ© des bottes parfaites pour les personnes de petite taille qui nÃ©cessitent une tige courte et un tour de mollet mince tout en ayant une pointure de taille 38.Je suis satisfaite de mon achat et je recommande ces bottes. Compre unas botas de montar y las he devuelto porque eran grandes.No me ha gustado nada haber tenido que pagar 43â\\x82¬ de gastos de devoluciÃ³n en correos. Me parece alucinante y un autÃ©ntico robo. Ottimo prodotto, molto comodo, l\\'unica cosa Ã¨ che alla caviglia restano appena abbondanti Super schÃ¶ne Schuhe !!An manchen stellen drÃ¼cken sie leider ein bissel am Anfang aber jetzt geht es !!Ich habe super tollen halt auf meinem Pferd und ich wÃ¼rde sie immer wieder kaufen !! Dopo due tentativi sono finalmente riuscito ad individuare la taglia corretta. Ottimo prodotto consigliato. Ottimo prodotto They are very soft, you can tell it\\'s good quality. I\\'d say though that they look more sporty in real life than in the pictures. I bit like football shoes, if that makes sense:) Still happy with the quality and the material. UtilisÃ©es pour le Tai chi, la semelle caoutchouc amortit vraiment trÃ¨s bien, les chaussures accrochent bien au sol mais permettent aussi de glisser les pieds pour les mouvements qui le nÃ©cessitent.TrÃ¨s bonne qualitÃ© et confort.La couleur claire fait que je les porte plus Ã\\xa0 l\\'intÃ©rieur en salle, qu\\'Ã\\xa0 l\\'extÃ©rieur. die Schuhe sind schÃ¶n warm, aber leider etwas klobig. Aber zum spazierengehen mit dem Hund ok. Muy cÃ³modas y calientitas Cute but the cut of these did not work for me, returned.  The insole was cushiony but the shape of the boot made it uncomfortable to walk in.  Also, the top of the boot has a large opening which is good for accommodating different sizes but it slides around unless you cinch it all the way with the laces which I think will crease the material over time and also just felt kind of weird.  I would like to see this concept redesigned since it is a cute style but just fits really strangely (sizing up or down wouldn\\'t have helped) and did not feel very practical. I was so DISAPPOINTED that these walking shoes would NOT allow me to slide my foot inside ! I\\'m 66 yrs old and walk my 82 lb dog twice a day.  These shoes looked like the perfect footwear for light snowfall days.  HAH. The opening at the top is too narrow and rigid.  There are no gussets that allow the opening to widen and accomodate your heel and ankle.  Very POOR design !  Because of that I cannot comment on the fit or comfort.  I had high hopes for these.  The tread on the bottom of the shoe and the ankle support would have made this a very stable shoe/boot. I really like these boots but I just wish they were a little bit more comfortable. I had to return my regular size and get a half size bigger because they definitely run small. I did keep the 7 1/2 because they are easy to wear and get around in in the city, but I find that my heel to slip out just a little bit even with my orthotics inside. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I would wear them every day but the days that I do with them they are pretty comfortable Looked nice-had to return too small Could not get my foot all the way in the shoe. No side zipper or opening at the shoe laces to open up the shoe I was unable to put my foot in the shoe. Returned immediately!! Warm. Look good. However the soles make my ankles legs and knees bend in. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be wearing them because of knee arthritis. Love new balance sneakers and was hoping these would be equally good. Nice boots. Devo dire che esiste un rapporto di amore/odio con me e questo specifico marchioI prodotti sono eccellenti, la qualitÃ\\xa0 costruttiva ottima ma, ogni volta che decido di acquistare qualcosa di questo marchio, finisco sempre per restituirlo.CONFEZIONE: bella e originale, completa di tutte le sue carte protettive sia interne che esterneMATERIALI E QUALITAâ\\x80\\x99:Allâ\\x80\\x99interno troviamo le scarpe e li notiamo subito la qualitÃ\\xa0 costruttiva e dei materiali. La pelle Ã¨ fantastica le cuciture e sono impeccabili. Allâ\\x80\\x99interno della scarpa, sotto al tallone e sul lato interno, troviamo un piccolo â\\x80\\x9cspessoreâ\\x80\\x9d in gomma che permette al piede di non affaticarsiPREZZO: se prese con le giuste offerte, riuscite a risparmiare anche il 70% rispetto al negozio.Lâ\\x80\\x99unico diffeto di queste scarpe sono le taglie: CONTROLLATE BENE LE TAGLIE !!!!!!Come giaâ\\x80\\x99 detto io le ho spedite indietro piÃ¹ volte, anche cambiando taglia ma non ho mai trovato quelle adatte a me. Inoltre le foto sono davvero fatte male e non consentono di capire bene lo stile della scarpa e come potrebbero stare ai propri piediCONCLUSIONI: Le consiglio come qualitÃ\\xa0 costruttiva e dei materiali, ma non ho avuto il piacere di poterle indossare nemmeno 1 ora e provare il loro fantastico design e comoditÃ The shoes were delivered in an ordinary unbranded box.. as if some local shopkeeper has send them.. the quality of shoes is bad and I doubt if it\\'s pure leather material or else.. also not sure if it\\'s original Clark\\'s product..  I\\'m in two minds if should retain or return it. La misura Ã¨ fedele a quella reale (forse la punta si allunga un po\\' piÃ¹ del solito, ma ritengo sia il modello).  Controllo QualitÃ\\xa0 da rivedere: non si assembla una scarpa quando la suola in gomma presenta bolle e dunque irregolaritÃ\\xa0 che, soprattutto sulla punta di una scarpa classica, sono fastidiose da vedere. Ho comprato queste scarpe durante un\\'offerta ad prezzo speciale (20â\\x82¬).Le scarpe sono di buone qualitÃ\\xa0 e si presentano bene. Forse mi aspettavo qualcosa in piÃ¹ a livello della qualitÃ\\xa0 della pelle, ma per il prezzo sono davvero ottime. La misura corrisponde fedelmente a quella che porto di solito. Che belle.. qualitÃ\\xa0 buona e anche il colore molto bello la pelle certo si vede che non Ã¨ la migliore ma a quel prezzo.. cmq sono meravigliosamente comode Scarpe comode. La suola Ã¨ fatta in un materiale che Ã© impermeabile all acqua. Il numero corrisponde a quello reale. Molto comode, ottimo confort, cuscinetto morbido al plantare e al tallone, buonr finiture in pelle. The shoe seemed like a cheap road side product. Forma molto bella, qualita\\' della pelle non Ã¨ un granchÃ© morbida Belle scarpe, ma quelle che sono arrivate a me avevano la suola deformata Molto belli e comodi Schnelle Liefe und Preis auch i.O.rung ces chaussures ne tiennent pas le piedla longueur est bonne mais impossible de serrer les laniÃ¨res afin que le pied soit bien tenu Estaba especialmente feliz de recibir este modelo ya que como es importado espere varios dÃ\\xadas, y oh sorpresa! Talla equivocada! Es la segunda vez que me pasa en productos de importaciÃ³n:/... Lo tuve que regresar ! El modelo estÃ¡ sÃºper bonito :( I do workout videos several times a week.  I like to make sure that my shoes can stand up to all the moves.  These shoes fit perfectly and are great to workout in.  I love the longer tongue on the shoes-I know that sounds funny, but they protect the ankle area more than most shoes do. Comfy love it nan Value for money Buen producto, muy cÃ³modos, el material se ensucia con facilidad es como tipo gamuza. QuizÃ¡s lo Ãºnico serÃ\\xada que para mÃ\\xad vienen anchos los Tennis, puesto que son amplios de la punta. Pero en general estÃ¡n bonitos, me gustaron ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82ð\\x9f\\x91\\x9flike like like Le scarpe che ho acquistato sono comodissime e di ottimo materiale Le scarpe sono perfettamente corrispondenti alla descrizione e all\\'immagine della pagina di amazon. Great sneakers . look great, thank you Why are athletic shoe companies putting these weird things under the soul? Is it supposed to be a gel pad or what? Instead of making the shoe more comfortable, it makes the shoe less comfortable. Please, just give us a nice smooth insole. . Donâ\\x80\\x99t put these gel pads in there because they donâ\\x80\\x99t work and we can feel them so it defeats the purpose.  If itâ\\x80\\x99s not a gel pad I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what it is. But itâ\\x80\\x99s a horizontal lump going from left to right under the ball of the foot area. Also I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the toe area, too pointy, prefer more rounded. I was worried b/c multiple reviews said these run large and order down a size but I wear a 5 which is the smallest size. They fit fine though and feel nice These are exactly as described. Reebok is the best!! I ordered an 8.5 and they fit perfectly This shoe is a knock off!!! The printed logo \"Reebok\" is supposed to be in the white part of the back area above ankle as seen in picture #1 above. Notice pic #2 doesn\\'t have it. For $65 it\\'s a rip-off I wasn\\'t sure if I would like these shoes because I couldn\\'t find many written reviews. I\\'ve searched the internet for a nice comfy white sneaker to go with every outfit. I didn\\'t want to spend a ton, definitely not over $100. I found these and prayed they would fit right, and not hurt my feet, and also look good. They are super cute, and fit very well. I\\'ve always been in between a 9 and 9 1/2, I never really know what size to get. I went for a 9 and they fit wonderfully. They are very comfortable , and I\\'m excited to wear them with every outfit and not ruin my feet! These shoes are very light weight, softly cushioned and very comfortable for all day wear! I got a half size bigger just because but I think itâ\\x80\\x99s okay to order true to size! Got a pair for my friend also, bought true to size and they fit her great! Easy to clean also, I just use a wet wipe after I get home for any marks or smudges. Taglia corrisponde, ho usate per una gita in citta\\' e devo dire che sono comode. Ein sehr schicker und bequemer Schuh. GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt perfekt. SchÃ¶n und bequem Feder leicht und sehen einfach schick aus. Die Schuhe kann man mit allem kombinieren. Ich finde das Material etwas fester, es kÃ¶nnten unschÃ¶ne Druckstellen/Blasen am FuÃ\\x9f oben entstehen. Und da der Schuh einen LackÃ¼berzug hat, kÃ¶nnte ggf. und schÃ¶ne Falten/Knickstellen entstehen. noch habe ich die Schuhe nicht ausgefÃ¼hrt und kann dazu nichts sagen, ist nur eine Vermutung. Da ich die Schuhe fÃ¼r ca. 32â\\x82¬ im Angebot gekauft habe, die schick aussehen, beim Probelauf zu Hause mega bequem und federleicht sind, hab ich die trotzdem behalten. Gebe jedoch auf Grund der oben aufgefÃ¼hrten Punkte insg. 4 Sterne. Ich hoffe ich war hilfreichNachtrag: nun hatte ich die Schuhe einen Tag lang an und habe wie befÃ¼rchtet Blasen bekommen. Deshalb nur noch 2 Sterne von ursprÃ¼nglich 4 Sterne. 1 Stern fÃ¼r das geringe Gewicht (federleicht) und 1 Stern fÃ¼r das Aussehen (sehen einfach super schÃ¶n aus und die Farbe ist mega), jedoch bringt das alles nix wenn die Schuhe hinterher Blasen bescheren. Also keine Kaufempfehlung. Ein toller Schuh, leicht, passgenau, sehr bequem - und auch optisch sehr ansprechend. ich trage den Schuh nun ein paar Tage und bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Kauf. Sehr auffÃ¤llig, chic mit dem Bugatti - Schriftzug Wie nach MaÃ\\x9f. Laufen sich super und leicht. Incredibly light weight and comfortable!!Nice quality and design! Ich besitze schon einige Schuhe von Bugatti und bin wie immer sehr zufrieden! Mein Wunsch erfÃ¼llt 8 Die Sneakers sind sehr schÃ¶n und tolle Innensohle. Empfehlenswert ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Very comfortable, recommended Ich habe Gr. 37,5 und bestelle immer Gr. 38. Diese Schuhe passen mir in Gr. 37, sind wunderschÃ¶n und bequem. WÃ¼rde mir am liebsten noch mehr Farben bestellen ;DNachtrag: Meine Kollegin und ich haben noch mal zugeschlagen. Sie hat einen breiteren FuÃ\\x9f (Gr. 37) und hat daher die Gr. 38 genommen. WunderschÃ¶ne Farben und sehr gute Verarbeitung. Ganz tolle und bequeme Stiefelchen mit beidseitigen ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss, das erleichtert das HinschlÃ¼pfen sehr. Ein wunderschÃ¶ner Sommer Schuh. Sieht original noch besser aus, als auf den Bildern. Bin sehr zufrieden. ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d SchÃ¶ner bequemer Schuh ich trage GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 37 und hab viel Platz. Einziger Kritikpunkt der Schaft ist etwas weit . Artikel gefÃ¤llt mir gut. Genauso wie in der Beschreibung.  PÃ¼nktlich Lieferung Sehr schÃ¶n! Awsome, comfortable light shoes. Wanted to buy this product for both casual and slightly smart casual wear, but the material isn\\'t really good for smart casual wear, so it sort of defeated my purpose for buying it. The Men\\'s Street Encounter series are much better, and the material used also more formal and suitable for smart casual wear. Shoes are overall quite light and easy to wear, but it simply didn\\'t fit my purposes. Would recommend for casual wear though! Too too small. I have wide feet, but I even had my daughter and granddaughter try them who wear a size 8, they both said they fit like a 6. Light and comfortable, love them. Le ho prese per la mia bimba di 11 mesi che giÃ\\xa0 cammina, le stanno perfette. Molto flessibili, comode da indossare. Anche per il grande ho preso delle Puma, le ritengo le migliori, soprattutto in qualitÃ\\xa0/prezzo QualitÃ\\xa0/prezzo. Sono carine e corrispondono al proprio numero. J adore.. tout Ã\\xa0 fait ce que je voulais pour la rentrÃ©e de ma fille.. je recommande vivement ces chaussures!! I lacci sono elastici e tendono ad allentarsi ma mi sembra una buona scarpa, che sostiene la caviglia, adatta anche a chi ha bisogno di inserire i plantari The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0Non e colore quello  che  lo  prenotato  io El zapato se rompiÃ³ muy pronto tiene un par de dÃ\\xadas de uso por lo que no recomiendo comprar este producto Producto sobrepaso las expectativas.. 100% recomendado These are a little fancier than I would send my kid to school in.They are more like a fancy occasion, Sunday church, holiday, or just an â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t find my sneakersâ\\x80\\x9d day (it happens).I was anxious about the â\\x80\\x9cslip onâ\\x80\\x9d as sometimes this style is actually harder to get on kidâ\\x80\\x99s limp feet as they donâ\\x80\\x99t tend to push their foot in to help you out at all when trying to get the shoes on. I was surprised that my kid could actually get these on all by himself and without any socks to ease the way to boot. Iâ\\x80\\x99m pleased that the elastic panels built in actually stretch enough so the kids can get their foot in.The quality of these is really good. They look and feel like a high quality menâ\\x80\\x99s shoe, just in a mini me, kidâ\\x80\\x99s size. This is a great shoe to match Dad in.My kid was so excited about his new shoes he ran errands around town in them the day he got them.Canâ\\x80\\x99t wait for him to wear these to picture day, etc.Overall Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend them. Pros:1. They work well for almost any occasion.2. Comfortable, my son has no complaints and gives them a big thumbs up3. They look very nice in person, very happy with the style.Cons:1. They are showing very slight signs of wear after a month but to be fair my child is very active.2. The materials used for these shoes arenâ\\x80\\x99t bad but also not high grade either.Overall these are a great pair of shoes. There is a little room for improvement but overall Iâ\\x80\\x99m happy with them and i would definitely get them again. I love that these have the utility of a sneaker but can slip on easily without my child needing to tie the shoes or mess with velcro straps!  Very well made, durable child shoe.  My child feels comfortable in them and has never complained about wearing them (he would be barefoot all the time if that were an option). They dry faster than most of his other shoes---which is helpful because he refuses to put on a wet shoe-and I don\\'t blame him!.  Worth the extra expense for its functionality and ease of putting on. My 6 year old likes these.  They\\'re comfortable and easy to slip on, they have good stretch to fit over his foot. They\\'re lightweight, too.They appear to be a well-made and attractive shoe.  No loose threads or wonky stitching.  They\\'re cute for summer with a pair of shorts, but they would dress up nicely with a pair of khakis.I\\'m very happy with these, I would definitely recommend. I like these shoes a lot. I got them for my son he needs a little more growing to do though i like to get them big so he can used them as much as possible. They are very soft on the inside, lots of cushion for the back of the heal. I can tell they are well made with hight quality materials and are flexible, slip resistance for outdoor activities all day long. Genuine leather is always a plus for any kind of shoes, they\\'re so much more durable. These are of a high enough quality that we will easily be able to pass them on to our youngest when our older son is done with them. Easy to slip on and off, and the elastic at the shoe\\'s opening helps with wider feet. Looks great with jeans and little boy khaki pants. I like the look of these shoes, and they seem to be high quality. I think they\\'re a great casual look -  nicer than sneakers without being too formal or grown-up. My son says they\\'re one of the most comfortable pairs he\\'s ever owned. Both of us enjoy the ease of them being slip-on. My 7-year-old loves these shoes. They are casual enough for everyday wear, but also nice enough when he needs to dress up a bit. They fit and feel like sneakers, but look like loafers. Great shoes for an active little guy. Schuhe wurden schnell geliefert. Leider waren rote EinfÃ¤rbungen auf dem Stoff.Daher habe ich die Schuhe gleich wieder zurÃ¼ckgeschickt. Everyone has Birkenstocks and I wanted something a little different, and I love Sorel shoes, so I gave these a try.  They are super comfortable and cute, though I have wide feet and this style is not flattering to my specific feet.  But I don\\'t care.  We are living through a pandemic and I want comfort.  And I can see beyond the ugliness of my feet to appreciate the beauty of these shoes.  Highly recommend!  Fit true to size. Great shoes! The quality is high! But Produkt is too large!!!The size indicated on the package 44.5 (31 cm) will suit you if your foot size is 46. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t like them as much at first. Gave me bad blisters, kind of slid off, almost returned them. But now I wear them all of the time! Great support. I bought these as a gift and the person I got them for loves them. She says they fit perfectly according to her size and are sturdy. Of course they\\'re sturdy; they\\'re Sorels! Size up 1/2 size. 9 fits just like 8 1/2. Very cute and comfy. Leather will stretch a bit. Very happy with this Sorel purchase! Comfortable, TTS, good quality. Attractive, good sale price and comfy Per ben due volte ho dovuto restituire l\\'articolo. Ordinato il n. 42, ma Ã¨ arrivato il 41. Per la prima restituzione col cambio articolo ho parlato anche con un\\'operatrice amazon per essere sicuro mi venisse sostituito con la taglia giusta, ma nulla da fare,  la sostituzione Ã¨ stata fatta sempre con taglia errata. The sandal did not grip my foot. I had a difficult time walking in them. Had to return. Muy buena pinta, suela blandita, pero demasiado pequeÃ±o. Talo 41, comprÃ© 41 y es pequeÃ±o, lo devuelvo. Desastre total. No tienen ni dos meses y apenas los he usado y ya estÃ¡n despegados o rotos por el talÃ³n. Belle e comode mio figlio ne Ã¨ soddisfatto Ottime Sneakers calzano bene e la suola interna Ã¨ molto comodo Preciosos Ordinato 42.5. Ricevuto 41.Pero lo stile, colore e qualitÃ\\xa0 sono top. Per questo due e non solo una stella. bellissime scarpe davvero comoda e molto minimal stile element nice Excelente producto Las zapatillas son muy bonitas, pero es la segunda vez que intento comprarlas y se equivocan con la talla. These may fit if I hope on to them in two or three years. I was really shocked at the size.  They were like 5 inches to long.  I had ordered one size up so went to different company ordered the size and is 12 and perfect fit. Little roomy and perfect. Will be sending them back if I don\\'t miss window. I was just shocked how huge.  I should have read the comments. My little one cried and cried.  They folded when she tried to walk in them.  It was like watching her walk in my shoes I bought these for our grandaughter she wears them all the time.  The boots are super cute and of high quality. They are  not a  cheap build like most I have seen at our local target stores. Well worth the money, especially if you have another younger  child who can wear  them after their sibling is done with them. Beautiful boots but be aware they are very heavy.  I bought them for my two year old granddaughter.  She can barely lift them.  A larger size for older kids would probably be ok... like a 5 year old might be able to handle them in their size.  But not ideal for toddlers. My 2 yr old granddaughter absolutely loves these boots. These are the only shoes she wants to wear. She can put them on and take them off by herself. They are well made. Easy to keep clean. You just wipe them off. My toddler is really a 5- but I wanted her to be able to put these on and off herself- so I expected them to be big and they were! She loves them and has been wearing them around the house. Itâ\\x80\\x99s raining today so it should be interesting to see how she likes them outside! My daughter loves these.  They are a bit larger than expected which is fine. Gives her room to grow. We live in Phoenix so it doesn\\'t rain often, but she\\'s thrilled to run and jump in muddy puddles and not ruin her good shoes. My daughter loves these!! These are perfect for little guys to pull on with the handles. We bought a coat and umbrella to match as well! Cant wait to jump in puddles! They run a little big but they are really cute my niece wears a size ten in toddler and these boots in size ten slipped right on and off her foot making it kinda hard for her to walk because of the looseness These boots were a Christmas gift for my 2  year old granddaughter . She wears a size 8 and these were roomy, however, she walks fine in them. VERY cute boots and she loves them! Theses boots have been worn ALOT since Christmas and still look super cute after being cleaned. My granddaughter loved these rain boots! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s three and loves Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Perfect gift. Klare Kaufempfehlung, passt, sitzt und hat Luft ! Sehr bequem, man hat das GefÃ¼hl barfuÃ\\x9f zu laufen. These shoes were perfect!  I got mine as a Christmas present and am so happy with them. They do run slightly larger than your actual size, so size down a half size. These are authentic because I keep seeing people asking. The ones with the serial numbers on them, that\\'s the style of those ones. For some reason Adidas decided to leave those like that. You can look at the actual Adidas website and you can cross reference those specific colors/styles and you will see that they have serial numbers on them from the actual website as well.  These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I\\'ve ever worn, they are the best! I forgot to write a review on this item, however I got these a couple months ago for my sister and she loved them. Not only did she say they were comfortable but they are also very stylish. They fit her nice and she loved them i got 10.5 like i always do with adidas shoes but had to return for the 10 and its still semi too large.  Not the most comfortable but they do look nice.  Probably won\\'t work out in these as i expected to be able to due to that. I know these shoes run large buy a .5 size down ! I get lots of compliments on these These are beautiful! I have one other pair in this style so I know they run large. I recommend sizing down one size. I\\'m normally a size 8 in womens but these i ordered a 7 and they fit perfect. Lightweight and comfortable. Love the color! absolutely love these. didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to pay full price for these shoes and they are perfect The shoes were a gift and they loved it! Perfect gift. Cute and functional all in one !! Recommend !! Run a little big. Go half a size down. Las zapatillas vienen en caja original con logo de CONVERSE. Todo parece correcto, por lo menos parece piel y tallaje grande como es habitual en esta marca. Yo suelo usar 39-40 EU en general (mi pie mide 26 cm. y es ancho) y aquÃ\\xad me pedÃ\\xad 38,5 y aÃºn me sobra quizÃ¡s algo mÃ¡s incluso llevando calcetÃ\\xadn (no media). El modelo es JUNIOR. No es ni de hombre ni de mujer. Pero si tienes pie que no pasas del 40 EU habitual puedes optar por comprar zapatillas de modelo JUNIOR. El tallaje que viene es 6 USA - 38,5 EU - 24 cm. En las Chuck Taylor de mujer uso 7,5 USA -38 EU - 24 cm. Me guie por la medida de cm. para ver si acertaba y parece ser que sÃ\\xad. Tengo zapatillas converse. Siempre son la misma talla. Hoy he recibido estas, y son tremendamente grandes. He pensado en ponerme una plantilla. AÃºn asÃ\\xad, tallan muy grandes...nada que ver con las converse que he comprado en zapaterÃ\\xadas. El lunes las devolverÃ©. AdemÃ¡s vienen en una caja de cartÃ³n marrÃ³n sin ninguna identificaciÃ³n, ni de marca ni de nÃºmero ni de nada....cuando lo normal seria que vinieran en su caja original. Lo dicho...el lunes las devuelvo...mal por todos lados. Bellissime e comode, specialmente per la mezza stagione. La tomaia in pelle Ã¨ leggera ma non fa sfreddare i piedi. La suola Ã¨ platform. Solitamente calzo un 38, ho preso un 37.5( ben sapendo che le Converse calzano grande rispetto a marchi come Nike ad esempio) ma sarebbe andato benissimo anche un 37 perchÃ© ha una calzata a pianta larga. Prezzo decisamente ottimo Scarpe ottime, sia esteticamente che come prezzo, ho acquistato come mio solito il 36,avevo giÃ\\xa0 altri modelli di converse e mi sono sempre trovata bene con il numero che porto di solito, queste risultano leggermente piÃ¹ grandi forse mezzo numero Ottima qualitÃ\\xa0, il prodotto rispetta le caratteristiche indicate;giuste le misure che corrispondono al numero che solitamente calzo....un particolare ringraziamento va al venditore che si Ã¨ dimostrato disponibile sin da subito a soddisfare la mia esigenza, professionale e molto cortese!! Genial. Tal cual la foto. La persona a la que se le ha regalado feliz. Dice son cÃ³modas. Lleva con ellos dos dÃ\\xadas. Esperemos den buen resultado. Genial!!! Llegaron antes de la fecha estimada.Han venido con su caja y son sÃºper cÃ³modas, eso sÃ\\xad, como ya leÃ\\xad que calzaban grandes cogÃ\\xad una talla menos y son las mÃ\\xadas!!! Tutto sommato sono belle, peccato siano enormi. Prendete 1 taglia in meno Todo bien Pedi medio numero mas q mi numero habitual y queda como 1 talla mas grande Las sandalisa estÃ¡n muy padres, son de buen material, muy ligero y comodo, la calidad de siempre de New balance.Ojo, no cometas el mismo error que yo, pidelas de tu nÃºmero, yo las pedi un numero mÃ¡s grande y no era necesario, vienen muy amplias. Country of origin:  These sandals are made in VietnamFinish:  These appear to be injection molded, so even though they might ultimately crack/tear, but they should be somewhat more reliable than the glued ones.Fit:  Very narrow width, extremely tight. My shoe size is 10.5, Medium width for my New Balance 990 series. Since these sandals do NOT come in half sizes, I ordered these New Balance sandals in Size 11, Medium width. Result?  Very NARROW WIDTH, and the fit is extremely tight and uncomfortable. Pretty disappointing. Not sure what size chart they used when manufacturing these, but it surely isn\\'t the same chart for fitting the NB 990 series.Conclusion:  If you are going to order these, might want to keep the caveat about narrow width in consideration. They\\'re sandals - not much else to say. The fit and color are as advertised. Decent value for money if bought on sale, although I probably wouldn\\'t pay full price for them. These are great sandles . bout them for running out to the hot tub, they seem good and durable . should last for years Aprietan un poco La caja vino algo aplastada pero es lo de menos, lls zapatos estaban sin detalles, me quedaron perfectamente.Los uso para entrenar box todos los dÃ\\xadas y si son duraderos Great quality and amazing comfortable CÃ³modos, super diseÃ±o 100% satisfied After 1 match, going all 3 min, it is loosing the color coating on the toe of the shoe. The black part is coming off and the red is showing through...just 1 Match!  This I am very disappointed about. Bought my son the solid black ones last season and they did great. That is what ultimately made me decide to purchase these this season for him. However, for $107.00 I expected to get a solid shoe that would take wear better than 1 match. My daughter got almost two seasons of wear out of these shoes. We just bought another pair in a different color because the first pair is starting to wear out. We feel this is a very acceptable amount of use. She loves the way they feel. Her women\\'s shoes size is 7.5-8 and she wears a 6.5 in the Mat Wizard 4. Had to return these. The started falling apart after four days of practice. The tongue came completely off on one shoe and the toe stitching came apart on both shoes. We have had kids wrestling for 10 years and have never had a pair of wrestling shoes that did not make it through one season. These did not make it through 4 days, which was a shame. The shoes felt good, and provided good traction on the mat. Initially I was submitting a better review, but i cannot honestly say they\\'re as good as we\\'d like. My son wears these for training and competitions. He said they\\'re pretty comfortable, but he\\'s only had them for seven weeks, and they\\'re looking ugly. They\\'re peeling and starting to come apart. I really hoped because they were Adidas brand, they would be better quality. Now I feel embarrassed for him when he has to show up at a Tournament and the shoes look like he\\'s had them for ages. Not very wide and comfortable compared to size 12 asics with medium thickness wool socks.As One is cloth and the other is some newer molded stuff.I wear thinner wool socks and fit snug. Can wear all day, during gym and errands, comfortably.Really grippy.  Just wish I could wear my normal wool socks. True to size. Very comfortable. I use the at the gym for cardio and working the heavy bag. Quality is solid. One downside is that theyâ\\x80\\x99re not very breathable as my feet sweat in these shoes a lot. Ottimo prodotto Fit exactly as expected.  My high school son loves them and was able to wear them right out of the box.  Highly recommend. Sleek shoe. It\\'s a perfect fit for my son. Very light shoe; when my son outgrows it, we\\'ll buy another just like it. This is a great starter spike. My son loves the feel how lightweight it is. great shoes! Great pair of track shoes. They held up for the season and then some. Would definitely buy again. Lovem!!! Nachdem ich in allen Schuh- und SportgeschÃ¤ften nach Badeschuhen gesucht habe und alle im Spann viel zu niedrig waren sind wir auf diese Schuhe gestossen. Wir haben sie 3 Wochen in BachlÃ¤ufen Korsikas getestet und fÃ¼r gut befunden. Man kommt super leicht rein, durch die Schnur kann man ihn passend machen und bequem waren sie auch.Allerdings muss man sie wirklich - wie schon beschrieben - mind. eine Nummer kleiner nehmen. Ich trage eine klassische 39 und habe sie in 38 bestellt und fÃ¼r meinen Sohn auch 1 Nummer kleiner. Daumen hoch! Die Schuhe sind hochwertig verarbeitet und laut meinem Sohn auch sehr bequem.Diese Badeschuhe fallen zwar grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer aus, aber mit dem Zugband lÃ¤sst sich der Schuh noch einstellen. Habe zwar gelesen, dass man eine GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe kleiner bestellen sollte, aber nachdem die Kinder schneller wachsen als der Schnittlauch im Garten, wollte ich doch, dass die Schuhe etwas lÃ¤nger halten. Zudem sollten Sie nicht ZU eng sein, wenn die Kinder rumlaufen und durch Hitze und Wasser die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe etwas \"grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer werden\".NÃ¤chste Woche werden die Schuhe dann dem HÃ¤rtetest (heiÃ\\x9fer Sand und Wellenspringen) unterzogen :) Mir waren die Badeschuhe besonders wichtig, da wir da in Urlaub waren wo es nicht nur super weichen Sand gibt, sondern auch Steine und gegebenenfalls auch die kleinen Fische auf die man nicht treten sollte.Die Schuhe sind schnell an und auch wieder ausgezogen und auch leicht mit SÃ¼Ã\\x9fwasser wieder ausgespÃ¼lt.WÃ¼rde ich immer wieder kaufen. Sieht gut aus, passt gut, preis ist auch ok. Deutlich weniger rutschen im Schwimmbad . Leider aber nach dem ersten tragen schon kaputt gegangen. Der Riemen zum verstellen ist abgerissen. Standard Schuhe, die ich auch woanders bekomme. Aber die QualitÃ¤t ist gut, nur das reingehen mit den FÃ¼Ã\\x9fen nervt. GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt, QualitÃ¤t top Mein Sohn hat GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 31, die bestellte GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe. Leider fÃ¤llt der Schuh derart groÃ\\x9f aus, dass er den Badeschuh im Wasser vermutlich verlieren wÃ¼rde. Dass ich jetzt die Kosten der RÃ¼cksendung (immerhin 1/3 des Kaufpreises) zu tragen habe, ist Ã¤rgerlich. 6 JÃ¤hriger mÃ¶chte in Kroatien Steinstrand Badeschuhe anziehen, direkt gerissen :-( Gut Die Schuh ist schon sehr bequem und stabilFÃ¼r Felsen Ã¼berhaupt kein Problem, gut gepolstertIch wÃ¼rde das hier weiter empfehlen I have worn many running shoes for my feet. From walking to trail to running, and I use this for everyday shoes too. As a past New Balance wearer, I did change brands to a different competitor but, I welcome the opportunity to come back to New Balance. The Men\\'s VENTR V1 Running Shoes slipped on like a glove! Silky, sleek and fits like a glove. Pampered my feet. I wore the shoes around the house to get a good feel for it. And one will know if the shoes will work within minutes. I wore the shoes for about a day, with no tiredness feet. It felt that I wasn\\'t wearing any shoes! Sure, am wearing in the house, and it hasn\\'t seen the outside terrain, but I do highly recommend New Balance VENTR V1 Running Shoes to anyone looking for shoes that gives them the arch support, great comforts for your feet and the price point to boot! Los compre para reemplazar mis ya viejos tenis de ejercicio (Cardio , estatico) , la medida que pedi fue la adecuada , son muy comodos y acolchonados , mi ejercicio lo realizo sin problemas sin causar molestia o cansansio extra en la planta del pie , tambien los he utilizado para caminar distancias largas y son super comodos para esto , el precio fue una ganga cuando los compre. El unico ojo es que hay que tener cuidado con la talla a adquirir. Not the best \"surprise\" feat to try and pull off, but I ended up buying these for my partner\\'s bday present. He was shocked that I bought him running shoes, but upon first \\'look\\' at them, his eyes brightly widened!These NB fit perfect-to-size, have been performing very-well for him as a light to moderate runner, and the look/feel of this shoe, is sleek and versatile.I try to wait a while prior to reviewing a purchase, and so far, approximately six-weeks in, he is raving about this shoe\\'s performance, feel, and look. Very sexy and comfortable shoe for running or dressing up jeans during the day or night!*I wouldn\\'t, however, buy this shoe today, at the price I see listed. A whopping CA$120 more than what I paid! Nuts!* After reading reviews a lot of people indicated the shoe fit smaller than it actually was and to be safe I ordered 1/2 larger . To be honest it was a big mistake the shoe to to larger :) It would have been nice to actually get the proper size . CÃ³modos, resistentes, se ven y se sienten de calidad, muy contento con la compra , tambiÃ©n los agarrÃ© en un excelente precio I have been using brooks and i am fine while walking long distances. I tried these new balance shoes and feet started aching. Will wear for another day and will change my review if its fine.  Shoes look good La talla se ajusta a mi tamaÃ±o de pie. No tengo problema alguno con ellos. Me encantaron y considero que fue buena compra ya que lo agarre de oferta. RelaciÃ³n calidad precio estÃ¡n muy bien, son tenis bÃ¡sicos pero bien hechos! Llegaron a tiempo.  Excelentes, justo lo que estaba esperando.  Muy comfortables y se adaptan perfectamente al pie.  Sin embargo, hay que agregar media talla mÃ¡s ya que si no quedan muy justos. Super cÃ³modos. Muy a gusto, la calidad de lo mejor. En pocas palabras super contento con el producto, por suerte los compre a un precio alrededor de 650 pesos. These things are great I have been using water shoes for years for cycling ,kayaking and the gym ,they are also nice to drive in ,if you can\\'t decide on a colour do as I did and get the pair with all of them ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a most arrive smelling like a chemical factory however these do not ! My feet love them and they fit wonderfully . Very disappointed. They fit properly, however the toe part tore on the very first day of wearing them to an indoor waterpark. My big toe was sticking out after getting out of the wave pool. What a waste of money!! I can\\'t wear these anymore. They don\\'t fit snug for use in the water. The material looks nice and well made and they are cute. Will look into getting a smaller pair. Love these! Fit perfectly and have a great sole. They are good enough to wear around the pool deck to protect my feet from the heat, and inside the pool, my feet donâ\\x80\\x99t get torn up from the bottom of the pool (its a public pool, so I feel itâ\\x80\\x99s more sanitary too).I take water aerobics and theyâ\\x80\\x99re so comfortable, I forget I have them on. Love them! Awesome little water shoes, wore them camping wear ae were in and out of water, swimming, kayaking,  tubing. Most water shoes give me blisters,  these didnt, and I wore them for 5 days. Threw them in wash when I got home,  air dried, good as new. They run alittle tight but loosen up as you wear them! Well worth the price! Overall no complaints. Bought to go river rafting. Had no issues with them slipping off and didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel the roughness of the rocks. We only did class 3 and below.The sizes are a little tricky I would buy a size down to make sure they donâ\\x80\\x99t slip off. These things are great!. With the price I thought maybe last 1 or 2 times on the river.Nope I crashed 3 times first trip. Kept my feet safe from rocks and when standing on rocks and mud my feet were secure and less muddy. I\\'ve used them every time I go kayaking. They are a must!!!!! I bought a pair for myself and for my husband. They are great. Three slip-on hugs the foot very well, and there is enough sole that protected the foot from broken sea shells while walking on the beach. They are the best I have 5 pair I even have my husband wearing them he also loves them they are so comfortably can be warn with anything they are great Looked nice when they came, but after two or three times in the pool they are coming apart. I suppose these kinds of swim socks are good for light use; they didn\\'t hold up to active swimming and playing in the pool. I was refunded. My two-year-old grandson loves them doesn\\'t want to take them off easy for him to put on and take off himself so that makes him feel awesome can I put a 3/4 warm because their summer sandals they\\'re not warm sandals but we really really love them they\\'re cute as can be Very cute. Die Schuhe sind einfach top. Mega leicht und sehr bequem und sehen klasse aus. Allerdings sind sie fÃ¼r einen schmalen FuÃ\\x9f gedacht. Gute QualitÃ¤t sauber verarbeitet. ich bin superglÃ¼cklich!! sie sind viel schÃ¶ner als auf Fotos, super bequem... demnÃ¤chst bestelle ich mehr fÃ¼r die Familie Sehr gut ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Absolut toller Sneaker Gute Passform, sehr leicht. Loved the color, loved the look and style of the sneaker, but they tend to run narrow and short in toe-box.  So, order at least 1/2 size up for best fit This is my third pair. Love them ! Pues confunde mucho la descripciÃ³n y el nombre. Hydrotrekker, Â¿por quÃ©? Porque vas mojado como una hidra, porque el empeine es de malla. Vamos que las he devuelto. Le scarpe sono perfette per nuotare e poi arrampicarsi sugli scogli: hanno un ottima presa. PerÃ² la suola si Ã¨ rovinata molto in fretta (le ho usate su rocce di granito) contenta con la compra , rÃ¡pido el envÃ\\xado , mÃ¡s bonitos en persona y lo mejor , son super cÃ³modos Gracias, estou encantada There was a hole the mesh UPDATE: I unfortunately had to reduce my review by 2 stars. After just a few hikes, the soles are falling apart. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a shame because I really loved these shoes.These were sooooo comfortable right out of the box. I get good traction and they handle getting wet very well. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re pretty cute too!I should also mention that I typically wear an 8, and although the front of my foot is a normal width, my heels are very narrow; these shoes fit me very well in a 7 Â½. These worked great for my recent trip to Zion National Park for hiking through the Narrows.  The shoe is comfortable and drains well.  I did size down a half size but otherwise fit well.  The shoes did take awhile to dry even though they drained well.  They were comfortable to wear, even without socks but did not offer much arch support.  If I were to wear them when not hiking through water I would need to add a shoe insert to provide arch support.  Overall worked great for what I needed them for and I will wear them again when hiking through rivers or tubing. SuperschÃ¶ne Schuhe, am Anfang wirkten sie etwas eng, aber nach kurzer Gehzeit, waren sie perfekt!Ich trage normalerweise GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 37 und das sind 37er, aber ich nehme ab nun an 1 GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer.Bei allen Minnetonka-Schuhen hÃ¤tte ich lieber 1 GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer nehmen sollen und werde sie auch in Zukunft grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellen.Bei diesen Schuhen geht es nach einer kurzen Gehzeit(ca.1 Stunde) aber super in 37.Vielleicht sollte man sie gleich eine GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer nehmen?Ich finde diese Marke groÃ\\x9fartig!Das Leder ist super schÃ¶n und weich. Die Schuhe sind toll verarbeitet und ein Hingucker. This is the perfect shoe for walking and moderate hiking--light enough to wear everyday and rugged enough for rocky and wet trails.  Just toss them in the wash when needed.  This summer I landscaped my hilly, and in places very muddy backyard in these shoes.  They held up and still look great. LOVE the look and color of these shoes and, in general, love Minnetonka products. I ordered my normal size, 8 1/2, and couldn\\'t even get my heel in the shoe. So I ordered a size 9. Though I could get my foot in the shoes, they were so narrow they hurt. This is the first product I\\'ve bought from Minnetonka that was so narrow. All their other shoes have run true to the width indicated. If you have narrower feet, these are for you! (My office mate loved them and now they\\'re hers!)I\\'m sorry they didn\\'t fit me as they are really good looking shoes. They are soooo comfy and great in the water! I love a shoe that you can hike and go in and out of creeks and waterfalls with out constantly changing sheâ\\x80\\x99s! This shoe is awfully heavy and seems to have no room inside.  I had to really  struggle to get my foot inside a shoe a half size larger than what I generally wear.  It was quite uncomfortable.  Since I purchased it at a much reduced price and it seems to be well constructed, I am sending the pair on to the thrift store.  It is my hope that the shoes may actually fit someone who really needs a new pair.  This is the first time I have been dissatisfied with Minnetonka shoes. I ordered a pair. Says \"men\" on listing so ordered smaller to fit woman size.  Shipped a women\\'s shoe at that size. Too small.  I reordered 3 pairs with Women sizes because I was going on a trip and needed them.  Checked cart. Said \"Merrell womens J033884 HYDROTREKKER SYN SHANDAL, Brindle, 9 US\" plus 2 other sizes/color.  Great! Correct sizes I thought.  Order arrived  with Womens  5.5, 6, 6.5.  NOT AT ALL WHAT I ORDERED.Now I have 4 pair to return. None of which is what I ordered. First time I have ever had a shoe in my size that has run too small. Great looking shoe though. I love these so much I sent a pair to my daughter...They are comfortable and cute...LOVE THEM The shoe is comfortable a d easy to get into. Love the color too? These shoes fit length wise just fine. But the toe area was too constricting. I have pretty narrow feet myself but these just felt like there was not enough height as well as width in the toe. Nice sneaker! Fits great and comfortable! Great color, style and comfort! I would definitely purchase these again. Most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. I wore them for less than two hours. The heal dug into two spots on my heals and caused huge blisters. The toe area also rubbed the skin off several toes. It was a week before I could wear closed shoes again. Super schÃ¶ner Schuh. Leider fehlten uns ein paar Dornen I like this running shoe.  I ran a virtual 10K road race and ran a pretty good time in them.  However, the metal spikes needed to be replaced after one 10K road race.  You should only run in this shoe on a Track (rubber or synthetic).  I wish the manufacturer would have specified that in that I nearly destroyed the shoe running on concrete and streets.  There is plastic grip teeth that were ruined.  Also, if you are a distance runner buy lots of metal spikes, the spikes will wear after run like a 10K.  Oh yeah running in the rain no problem, the shoe itself does not absorb water like trainers, but your feet will get wet.  For the price I paid, under $40.00 not a bad purchase.  I am going to buy another pair. My daughter loves these shoes! She is a sprinter in track and said these really helped step up her game. Her only complaint is she wishes the laces were longer! She struggles to tie them, she canâ\\x80\\x99t double knot it! So during her 200 run they came untied and she placed 4th because of it! This is an awesome shoe but the sizes run small.  I may have converted the sizes incorrectly.  But since they are sold in mens sizes, I purchased a 6.5M to get a 8.5W.  Although we were a little disappointed, we were able to return the shoe, at no cost, for the correct size! These are great track sneakers. My daughter has requested the same pair for the second year. Spikes are easy to put in and take out. Very lightweight. I wish that this shoe came with extra spikes. Had to go buy spikes immediately. I had bought these for my daughter & tried to diff sizes but she said they were uncomfortable. She\\'s flat footed & needs wide shoes so I believe that might be what the problem was. Too narrow for her feet. As with most spikes they tend to run small. These fit better for our runner than the Saucony style. Bought a pair for my 12yr old daughter. She loves them. She has set two personal bests wearing them. Good spikes. Exact product, great price, quite ship. Highly recommended. I liked these shoes at first. I liked the simple look and the comfort. But, the first time I wore them in actually rain, my feet got wet! Really bummed because Iâ\\x80\\x99ve missed the return window now. sehr gutes Material, ideal zum wandern und outdoor These are great shoes. My review reflects the fit as tighter than others of the same size but different brand. I would recommend going at least 1/2 size up Runs small wide is very narrow I have very large feet. I bought the largest size and they actually fit very well. I love walking in Skechers Because I have neuropathy in my feet and they help me keep going all day long. La verdad no esperaba que quedaran tambien, el acoginamiento en el tendÃ³n de la parte trasera del pie lo hace un zapato muy comodo. Lo recomiendo para gente que gusta de zapatos que no le molesten en ninguna parte del pie y que les encante la comodidad. El mateiral como de gamusa a lo mejor dificulta un poco su limpieza, pero en relaciÃ³n con al comodidad que representan es un detalle insignificante Excellent comfortable Bonne qualitÃ© Great shoes The shoes are very comfortable. These are seriously one of the most comfortable shoes I\\'ve ever owned.  First pair of Skechers and I\\'m in love.  I have wide feet and my left foot is half a size bigger than my right, so I usually can\\'t just buy shoes without trying them first.  I intended these to be personal shoes to use when I go out of the house with the family but don\\'t want to wear running shoes.  But I\\'ve found myself bringing them to work because they look very professional and at the same time feel very comfortable.  I get about 12,000 steps a day when I\\'m at work so these have been amazing feet savers.  I even used them to teach a dance class and forgot that I wasn\\'t wearing my dance shoes because they didn\\'t stick to the wooden floors like basketball shoes yet have much more comfort than formal dance shoes.  I\\'m definitely getting another pair. I\\'m glad I took another reviewers advice and ordered a half size larger than what I normally wear.  My sneaker size is 9.5 but I ordered a 10 in this shoe and it fits just right.  The memory foam is perfect as I work in a retail environment and am on my feet many hours a day.  The casual loafer style also fits my work environment. I am very happy I made the decision to purchase this pair of shoes and will probably buy more in different colors. The price here can\\'t be beat. I purchased another set of \"memory foam\" loafers at a local payless chain and for $10 more than what I paid for these Sketchers they are not even close in comfort. Highly recommend these. These are exceptionally comfortable loafers. They are very light and they have the very comfortable memory foam insole. I have a relatively high instep, so loafers do not always work well for me. These are surprisingly comfortable. Oddly enough, they are more comfortable to walk around in than they are to wear while sitting (high instep thing ... I guess). The material seems to breath better, my feet to not get as hot as they would with other shoes. The quality of the materials and of the construction is top notch. I may even buy another pair in a different color. Super comfortable. Easy on and off. I can walk miles at a time and feet fell fine. I bought these for a exact replacement of my very worn pair should they ever wear out. I later bought another pair because my old ones were very worn. This last pair is exactly the same and beyond great for walking and comfort. Easy to put on and off is a great feature also. Iâ\\x80\\x99m searching for a cute yet quality shoe for a trip to Barcelona in fall.  This shoe was almost perfect.  Its really very pretty (I got the wine color).  Itâ\\x80\\x99s very comfortable, and the material has a lot of stretch and giveâ\\x80\\x94 comfortable out of the box.  The only uncomfortable part was that my big toe rubbed on the top of the shoe.  Not the endâ\\x80\\x94 they were the right sizeâ\\x80\\x94 but the top, which bothered me while I walked.  If youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking about these, definitely give them a try though. I really want to love these but the support isn\\'t there. I wish there was a Chaco support lightweight type of running shows. It still feels light. It\\'s like putting you foot in paper. That\\'s how light it is. I have flat feet so it does hurt to walk in these. Still very cute. I\\'ve loved chacos sandals for several years. I was thrilled to find out they carried regular shoes when my work pair were coming to the end of their life. I work on my feet and my fitbit reports between 7,000 and 10,000 steps a day. These have been great. They have the arch support I\\'ve come to expect with chacos and are as lightweight as my off duty slide on sketchers. As long as they turn out to be as durable as my sandals these will be a phenomenal purchase. The only thing I dislike is that the padding on the upper part of the back of the shoe is not enough.  They cause blisters on my heel at the top.  I hope that stops as they break in because the rest of the shoe is great. I have very high arches and am constantly battling planter fasciitis.  Chacos tend to work well for my feet so i thought I would try these for running and walking.  I added my own insoles on top of the ones that came with the shoes and have been running for 4 weeks with no problems! I bought these when I needed something to wear for hiking AND city walking that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t ugly AF like most hiking shoes. Here I am two years later, my Chacos have strolled through nature trails and city streets in 30 states and 3 continents. The tread has finally worn down, so Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting a second pair. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re great! Thank goodness for hiking shoes that come in civilized black, rather than fugly swirly browns. I love these shoes. I have walked, lite hiking and worked in them. They run just a little small. I ordered my normal size. I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes have been great for that. I was hesitant to buy tennis shoes from Chacos. I adore their sandals and the high arch support, but wondered if the same could be accomplished in their tennis shoes. I was wrong; these are awesome. I get on the treadmill first thing in the morning, and those of us with PF know, that\\'s when the worst pain is. These make it so. much. better. Highly recommend. Was looking for a shoe for work,on feet and a lot of walking,that have a footbed like a pair of cheap flip flops bought last year that are similar to chacos. The flip flops are all I wear when not working, don\\'t hurt my feet. So far,so good, just wish they came with a choice of width and my feet are different from each other. Like other reviews,on one heel it rubbed and the opposite foot it rubbed pinky toe with socks on, irritating! Just have to break-in. I go through \"work shoes\"/inserts about 6 months.  On a side note, didn\\'t appreciate the UPS man just throwing the package on porch! Just because no car doesn\\'t mean no one home and watching. I absolutely love these shoes!Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ordered 2 pairs so far. Some of my favorite things about this shoe is that thereâ\\x80\\x99s little to no need to â\\x80\\x9cbreak inâ\\x80\\x9d the shoe, they fit my wide feet very comfortably, they are very sturdy, and they are very comfortable and I can walk for miles and not get blisters! I mainly wear them for work. I work in a kitchen as a waitress and these do an amazing job. They grip well on slick surfaces, I just wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t run on the slick surfaces. My last pair lasted me just shy of a year, but I did wear them pretty much everyday walking anywhere from 4-6+ miles a day give or take. They are also great for most  hiking endeavors.I highly recommend these shoes if youâ\\x80\\x99re looking for a light hiking shoe or a gripping work shoe. Another well made product from Clarks. I\\'ve been wearing the Clarks brand for over 25 years now, and with just a couple exceptions, I have not been disappointed. When I order a size 12, I know it will fit right out of the box with mostly no break in period. These shoes are comfortable for every day wear and work. Very happy with the purchase. Short break in time and great. I\\'m on my feet all day. Did not feel fatigued at the end of the day. They were very comfortable. This is a great product! I would purchase Narrow shoe nowhere near US sizes..not real clarks.. Wear to work Shoe is very comfortable. Came quick and packaged well Mi sono arrivate un paio di scarpe numero 27,da bambino ð\\x9f\\x98\\x85, Amazon hai toppato alla grande.Ã\\x88 la seconda volta che mi succede con un paio di scarpe, ma l\\'altra volta l\\'errore ci stava un 20 al posto di un 24,stavolta al posto di un 43 un 27ð\\x9f\\x98\\x85.Le metto come portafortuna appese allo specchietto della macchina? ð\\x9f\\x98\\x82 Ho ordinato un 43 ed Ã¨ arrivato un 27.

This is a great shoe, feels like a foot glove.I wish they had a wide size though it would have been super. This is the most comfortable running shoes i\\'ve ever wear. Amazing shoes. Soft, light and cozy. Nothing to say more. Thank you Seller! Good for running Adidas os best It was a bit of a wait, but completely worth it! Amazing shoe. I love them. Improperly described I purchased these sneakers for my son and they were listed as mens. When I received the shoes they said women\\'s on the box and looked like women\\'s sneakers. Very disappointed. Great shoes! I have a high arch and slightly wide foot, plus I suponate when I run. These fit perfectly and have the right support to keep my feet from rolling out. Plus half the price of my normal running shoes!! They also did well for lifting. Le scarpe sono belle ma il rinforzo in plastica che dovrebbe tenere il piede piÃ¹ fermo dopo 1 mese di utilizzo si Ã¨ rotto in entrambe le scarpe. Viene usata da un ragazzo di 15 anni di peso 55 kg per pallamano. una scarpa di questo tipo non puÃ² rompersi dopo 2 mese di allenamenti. SCHUHE fÃ¼r Gr.43 ein bisschen zu gross. Guter Halt fÃ¼r die KnÃ¶chel,  Qualitativ hochwertiger Schuh. Zapatillas buenÃ\\xadsimas para jugar a balonmano. RelaciÃ³n calidad - precio excelente y el envÃ\\xado rapidisimo The shoes had very little support. This contributed to injury Pris un 38 pour un 38 elles conviennent parfaitement et en plus elles sont jolies et classe au top I bought these for my son because I was having a hard time finding a men\\'s version in his size. The first time he wore them he set a PR in his 800. He has continued to improve and set PRs as a freshman runner in track. The shoes are comfortable enough for him to run his 800 and the 3200. They are very lightweight and yet durable because of the way the shoe is made and the material. My daughter uses this for track season and she was very pleased. The shoes are bright, which made it easy to spot her clear across the track: I just looked for her shoes when she was with her teammates in uniform and she was easy to spot. The shoes were very light, not heavy at all, which made them perfect for her to run in. For normal shoes, I am a size 7.5. I always wear size 8 for Saucony trainers, and 8.5 for Saucony spikes and XC spikes, but for these, they are really thin so I got 8 and that was perfect. good quality for cost! Ojo en algÃºn lado dice que son de piel. NO lo son o para ser mÃ¡s exactos son de piel Vegana. Para el precio que tienen me estoy pensando en devolverlo. Daughter loves them My 12 year old daughter really likes this shoe. She said it is comfortable and fits very well. Someone else really likes it too since they stole her first pair lol! Not wide enough for my own feet.  Nicely made product though. good quality I only received one side of this shoes.need the other side.need the left. Beautiful shoes! Very thin and an exact fit to my size 7 foot. Since they are thin there is not much between them and the ground. There is very little arch support so would not recommend wearing more than few hours; especially if you have a chronic plantar. La mejor compra!!!! Hermosos, llegaron desde Estados Unidos en solo 5 dÃ\\xadas contando el fin de semana. La talla es perfecta, la calidad impecable. SeguirÃ© comprando sin duda alguna a Amazon pues el precio de oferta menos de la mitad que la tienda acÃ¡ en MÃ©xico y excelente calidad. Gracias Amazon!

Excelentes materiales y muy cÃ³modos Esta hermoso el modelo y sÃºper cÃ³modo They fit bigger and are heavier than the Nike sneakers my daughter has but they look amazing!Really good sneakers for the price! The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8dð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Perfect. I let my daughter pick. I ordered a 1/2 size up as recommended. I probably could of gone a full size up. But my daughter has a narrow foot and I was afraid her foot would â\\x80\\x9cflop outâ\\x80\\x9d. So we will pay the extra and go up a size as needed. If your child as a more average size foot, I would say you could size up at least 1/2-full size if they are on the cusp of that growth spurt. If your child has a wide foot, I do not recommend these shoes. Again-this is MY OPINION. I feel has been very fair and honest. In the picture it shows laces. What I received was Velcro!  Twice!!!! Not happy Not as described, what made these look so undesirable was the fact that they came with a giant velcro strap across the top. THIS STRAP WAS NOT IN THE PHOTO. So I feel I was fooled. They look like old men  shoe. SAD! My son was excited for these shoes. Unlike others, I WAS looking for velcro, because although he knows how to tie his shoes, he would rather slip them on and off, and I would rather still have a decent, rather then broken heel of his shoe. Turns out the heel was not the problem!! Instead, the toe part (it is cloth-woven on top of a more solid base) of the shoe began to unravel a couple months into wear, and now it looks completely frayed (over an inch or so) and tacky, revealing the plastic form of the shoe underneath. Otherwise the shoe has held up great, the white part in the front is fine, the tread on the bottom, it fits, he loves it, etc, but he will be getting a new pair of a DIFFERENT shoe, because I am not taking my chances on this pair again. These shoes are wonderful Adidas quality, but as others have stated, the item description is incorrect.  I ordered the royal blue color with laces, and received a velcro closure. It\\'s otherwise a fantastic shoe, and the velcro closes all the way across, and stays shut. I think my son (almost 10) is just about too old to velcro, he disagrees so we\\'re keeping them.  But I\\'ll choose a different style next time. After being loyal to UA and Nike shoes for kids, I\\'ve recently dabbled in purchasing some Adidas shoes and am pleasantly surprised by their comfort and quality.  They tend to run slightly bigger and more true to size than Nike, which run small, and are better quality than UA which tend to wear quickly and have color wear off.  The Adidas are really the best if both Nike and UA with sizing and quality.  These are lightweight, attractive and fit well.  These are nice kids shoes and worthy of five stars. This shoe doesn\\'t actually have the velcro strap, as it appears to have in the product image.If your child is like mine and not the best at tying their shoes yet, then you know that the velcro strap really comes in handy (which is the main reason why I selected this shoe to purchase), so needless to say, I was pretty disappointed that the product image was inaccurate.Other than that though, it\\'s a good shoe and we decided to go ahead and keep it and continue perfecting our shoe-tying skills. They fit great! But we had these shoes for a month before they started falling apart. My son is 5. I bought these because two kids in my son\\'s daycare ages 1 and 3 have these shoes and they\\'re adorable. However, after a month they started falling apart. The toe part now looks like a dog started eating them. Its so sad especially for the price. Walmart shoes may have been a better bet for quality. I am a 73 year old Breast Cancer Survivor almost 9 years only 4\\' 11\" tall and wear children size shoes 3-1/2 XW.  Was thrilled when I found a pink shoe in the Big Kids Size that fit me perfectly.  It has extra depth so I can insert my Alegria insole protecting my feet that no longer have muscle due to chemo side affect.  Thank you for having this amazing shoe just right and comfortable for me when I walk or go to my Cancer Survivor Exercise Class!! I\\'ve been buying new balance shoes for several years for my kids.  The new v4 of the 990\\'s is just not good.  The quality has gone down, the fit is different and the shoes are completely falling apart in less than 2 months.  Stitching is coming out, hole in mesh on top of shoe, etc.  What\\'s really shameful is that the cost of these v4\\'s went up so much compared to the v3\\'s.  When the quality comes back I\\'ll reconsider. I think that the shoes are really nice, but I ordered the light grey 990 V4 in the size that my son normally wears and the shoes were like a half of a size 2 small (length). I went back to order the next size up and they were sold out. I ended up ordering the NB 888 in dark grey (Magnet) and they are even nicer with better support than the newer version 990. DISGUSTING! I cannot even believe someone would pack these nasty shoes and pass them off as a new. Returning! These are the ONLY tennis shoes my 5 year old can wear.  He has a wide foot with a large instep and he has trouble getting his feet in shoes.  These shoes are great because they come in a WIDE and EXTRA WIDE.  We bought the extra wide and they fit him perfectly and were super comfortable. The shoes were really nice. I loved the color and how they looked on my sons foot. They fit exactly and the goal was to get them in a bigger size but the size was unavailable. I will purchase them again in a larger size for later as he grows. They were tremendous with issuing my refund. I did not like having to pay for shipping as part of my refund but the shoes were incredibly inexpensive so no complaints here. Very nice quality and look. My child is very particular about her shoes and needs a wide space for her toes. These extra wide shoes are perfect. Couldn\\'t find any other shoe out there to meet her needs. Fast shipping. The shoe colors are off. The soles are thinner than the original 990. Not as much support. Emailed the support team about my concern but they never responded back. Returning the product. My foot doctor explained that the shoes are built so that they tilt inward in the heel area as most people walk this way.  Huh?  That\\'s just plain nuts.  Secondly, the gray pair I bought a few months ago--same shoe--the back of the heel area--not the bottom of the shoe--has compressed after 3 weeks of wear.  After spending $80 on this New Balance 990 shoe, it\\'s unwearable.  What a waste of my money.  We\\'ll see how these new ones wear.  I\\'m not holding my breath. Seems to be a comfortable supportive shoe. As an adult female who still has to wear kid\\'s shoes, I have a very hard time finding anything appropriate to wear. I hope New Balance continues to make at least one or two styles that are not pink and sparkly! Meine Tochter hat den Schuh genau einmal getragen, und jetzt kann ich ihn wegschmeiÃ\\x9fen, weil der ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss kaputt ist. ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss hÃ¤lt nicht-Schuhe wurden nur ein paar mal getragenBitte um LÃ¶sung dieses ProblemsVerbleibe mit lieben GrÃ¼Ã\\x9fen Bauernberger Mathias der Reissverschluss geht etwas schwer zu, aber sonst ein schÃ¶ner Schuh Der ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss an der Seite geht fast nicht zu, Kinder Schaffen es alleine nicht und Erwachsene mÃ¼ssen kÃ¤mpfen Cerniera rotta dopo averle indossate 5 volte Benutze den Schuh tÃ¤glich, Lauf jeden Tag zwischen 5 und 10 Kilometer. Optisch ein schÃ¶ner Schuh, alles in allem ist der Schuh zu weich, man merkt im GelÃ¤nde jeden Stein unter der Sohle, schade. Denke nach einem halben Jahr bei der Laufleistung ist das Ding durch. FÃ¼r jemanden der nur ab und zu mal wandern geht denke ich ganz Ok. Wirklich hochwertige Schuhe, leider fallen diese Recht klein aus, weshalb ich sie leider zurÃ¼cksenden mÃ¼sste. Ottimo prodotto (lo conoscevo giÃ\\xa0)...ma la cosache piÃ¹ ho apprezzato Ã¨ il notevole costo inferiore rispetto ad altri punti vendita.... vanno bene per una camminata di massimo 2 ore....pessima tenuta sulla parte alta del piede e suola troppo morbida per terreno sconnesso FÃ¼rs Hundegassi top,vorallem Wasserfest. Fazit nach 3 Monaten: Laufkomfort super, auch bei Wanderungen Ã¼ber 3 Stunden.Leider starker VerschleiÃ\\x9f der Sohle durch tÃ¤glichen Gebrauch (Spaziergang mit den Hund). Passt! Hatte schon einen CMP Schuh; gleiche Passform. Ich bin begeistert! Superschnelle Lieferung, Top Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis, wurden schon eingelaufen und fÃ¼r bergetauglich bewertet Great looking shoe.  Can wear casually for work.  Get lots of compliments! Very comfortable. Beautiful metalic gold. Nice shoelaces 2 pairs white and beige with gold ends.Love them. Since they are original keds they where what expected ! Fast shipping and great pricing, thank you Great comfy shoes!! EXCELENTE PRECIO, SUPER COMODO. LO QUE ESPERABA. ME ENCANTO I love it, I love it. Wouldn\\'t mind buying other colors. Sehr schÃ¶ner und bequemer Sneaker von ARA.  Weiches Wildleder, fÃ¤llt grÃ¶Ã\\x9fengerecht aus, stoÃ\\x9fdÃ¤mpfende Sohle und WechelfuÃ\\x9fbett - klare Kaufempfehlung! This is a great shoe for dressing up or casual wear. Love the style, color and fit (I wear an 8, had to send it back for a 7 1/2 which was absolutely no problem for return). I do have a narrow foot, so that is the reason for the smaller shoe. Very comfortable and good support. I love love love these shoes! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a similar pair for five years and am so happy I found more of the same company/style on here. the absolute best and comfiest womenâ\\x80\\x99s shoes!!! I am always on the lookout for sporty shoes that I can slip on and don\\'t have to wear socks with. It\\'s not an easy find. With that said, these shoes are sporty and quite cute. They look almost knit and the gray color is a nice neutral. I was really pleased with how the shoe looked.In addition to a cute shoe, I require a decent amount of arch support (I love Vionic shoes). I purchased these because of all of the reviews noting these had great arch support. I have one question.....Where is said arch support? If you are expecting a decent amount of arch support (like a Vionic shoe) - this is NOT it. The insole has a bit of bump - else it\\'s pretty flat without a lot of padding. I was super disappointed in how flimsy the insole was. The good thing is the insole is removable, so if you love the shoe and need more support - you can easily add your own insole. I purchased this pair of Ryka ballet flats to replace a pair I bought a couple of years ago that I had worn out.  They are so incredibly comfortable and are the perfect flat to wear when you need to be a little more shoe than a pair of sneakers but not dragging out a pair of heels! I really like the Ryka black flat with a black sole.  No more clown feet with those big white rubber bumpers.  Shoe is comfortable in every way I appreciate...fit, style, lightweight and flexible, breathable fabric, and looks attractive with all of my pants and capris.  True to size in a size 10W... even a little room to wiggle my toes. I have several pairs of Ryka, all size 6.5.  I love the brand. These were huge in the heel area and a bit wide across the bridge of my foot. Before you ask I double checked to make sure they had not sent me the 6.5 Wide. It is stamped 6.5 M.  I am so disappointed because they are just what I needed. I do not think the size 6 would be any better due to the width. Absolute Comfort is what first comes to mind with these.  With these available in a Wide width it made for a perfect fit at 6 1/2 W.  These will be my go to slip ons for around the house, no break in needed.  I love them, it is like they were made for my foot!! I ordered this in black and came back for two more colors.  I wear a size 9 and it was a full size 9 with a little room.  It is not narrow or tight, which I like.  I have been looking for comfy flats for awhile and Ryka got it right. I ordered these in a 7.5 wide and they fit my wide foot comfortably. I do not notice any arch supports. I like these shoes. It is hard to find cute shoes for a wide foot. They are comfortable for a short term wear however I have not tried wearing them for super long periods of time so I cannot attest to how they feel after wearing for a whole day. These shoes are comfortable out of the box. I\\'ve been wearing them almost everyday since receiving them. When they get dirty, I toss them in the washer on delicate cycle and then air dry. I bought these for my son and I was hoping they would be a good choice for the winter weather.  He likes them but one issue is that they\\'re not comfortable for all day wearing. Returned them. Too stiff and narrow for an athletic tween. Awesome boots Cool Great Very  comfortable ,my grandson  loves  them. Keeps  feet very  warm. Great Stuff! Nice boots My son hasn\\'t complained that they hurt, so far so good.  Fits well.

These sneakers are comfortable, not as light as running shoes but good enough for being casual sneakers. The size is a bit bigger than expected. I got a Women\\'s 7.5 US size and it\\'s equal to a 39 2/3 EU size (usually a 7.5 it\\'s a 38 or 38.5 on other brands). i liked the retro design and the chunky look ..also was a great price for this brand so i assumed it would fit wide..but it only looks wide but feels narrow on the toe part, hurt the feet I like these shoes but they are way way way too big. I am a size 7.5 and I ordered my size and they fit more like a 9.5! Massive shoes and not true to size. I gave them away Increibles I like the shoe, just like the picture A little rough inside These shoes are a little heavy but that is likely because I tend to go for lightweight sneakers. The shoes are really cute and Love the style. My issue is comfort. I wore these for a day and they are not small but something about how they fit causes some discomfort around my toes and ankle. Not unbearable and there is enough room to wear thicker socks that should offer some more comfort. Where them when I going to the park if you have over arching feet this isnâ\\x80\\x99t the shoe for you, the sole on the ball isnâ\\x80\\x99t that thick so after awhile my feet start to hurt but if youâ\\x80\\x99re just wearing for a couple hours theyâ\\x80\\x99re great A little narrow. But overall cool retro look. Excelentes estÃ¡n fenomenales, al venir de Amazon USA ya van 2 veces que no me llega con caja original , la cambian por maltrato de transporte en cuanto al tenis estÃ¡n de lujo CÃ³modas y bonitas Der Schuh ist sehr bequem und leicht zu tragen. Alles so wie erwartet. The sizing of these is way off. I listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal (I wear a lot of NB shoes of this same style) and they were right I needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow. I returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also. so I guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit? I give up.  I wouldn\\'t recommend ordering these online unless you know for a fact what size is appropriate. Try these on first if at all possible. I purchased these shoes a little under 2 weeks ago and am not impressed with the durability of the stitching on them. I skate maybe an hour every other day but I do not do any crazy tricks, an Ollie and kickflip if Iâ\\x80\\x99m feeling it and this is just from a small time frame of wearing them. My previous vans half cabs lasted 9 months. I had heard good things about New Balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all. They are also not comfortable in the slightest, even after wearing them in a good bit. Maybe I got a bad batch but if not, do better New Balance. I ordered the 11.5 Wide, since New Balance has been exceptionally consistent in sizing for me. To my surprise, these did not fit when I tried them on. The reason is they\\'re not the standard 4E wide for New Balance, but only 2E wide. I tried two of these before realizing the problem. They look great, but if you\\'re buying it for the width, be sure to know they\\'re not standard wides. I like these shoes.  They\\'re comfortable, and look cool.  But like the other reviewers stated......order one to 1.5 sizes larger than you normally do. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t even know that New Balance made skate style shoes. These shoes look nice and feel great. The only thing I am not a fan of is the big â\\x80\\x9cNâ\\x80\\x9d sticked on the side. Branding is branding... oh well. The shoes breathe and help keep the feet from getting a serious case of the stankfoot. I should have paid closer attention to the reviews!  I have purchased several New Balance shoes and these 9.5W are tighter than past pairs.  I have been thinking that the material will break in over time; however, the tightness is around the panels that secure the sides/laces.  That firm material doesn\\'t seem to have much give and it immediately aches.  Other than, the shoe is well constructed.  I\\'m disappointed I will have to return the shoes for a 10W. I bought my original fit that I buy for all shoes and these were nowhere near the size.  I couldn\\'t even get the shoes on over my toes.  I got refund so no harm no foul. Commfy Die Schuhe sehen niedlich aus. Da sie so aufdringlich riechen, habe ich sie 2x gewaschen. Sie stinken immer noch elendig, so dass ich sie meinem Kind nicht anziehen mÃ¶chte, da ich denke, dass sie nicht gesundheitlich unbedenklich sein kÃ¶nnen. Wie bei jedem Kappa Schuh ist die Passform perfekt. Durch den schmalen Schnitt wirken sogar meine FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe in GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 43 klein:-) Super weicher Material. Mein Sohn benutzt zum FuÃ\\x9fball!!! ARTICOLO ARRIVATO SENZA SCATOLA ORIGINALE E SENZA FATTURA O SCONTRINI. DUBITO CHE LE SCARPE SIANO ORIGINALI!ð\\x9f¤¨ TrÃ¨s bien et adaptÃ© Ã\\xa0 son utilisation. Super bon achatBonne grandeurParfait Bought these for my son for Xmas .  He absolutely loves them. Very bright and super comfy. Fit, comfort, price ..... all good Very good quality for the price light and comfortable!!! I have two wild boys whom are 7 and 10.  They love gym and are always involved in at least one sport per season.  They are very hard on shoes because they live to run and jump.  We bought several pairs of the Reebok ATV after my oldest son saw the great commercial for them and decided he had to have a pair.  My boys wore the crap out of them and loved every minute of it.  Please bring those shoes back.  We have been hooked on Reebok for their comfort and durability ever since.I bought each of my boys a pair of the Yourflex Train 10s for Christmas to wear to school and for Gym class.  The different colored tread on the bottom of the shoes have begun to come undone after two days each.  It was obviously added last in the factory in order to enhance the appearance, but is a complete fail as it has lowered the functionality of the shoe tremendously.I\\'ve seen this happen with other shoe companies that attempt the same visual tactic.  In the future, I will not buy any shoe that screws around with the sole like this.  I\\'m disappointed Reebok.  I\\'ve grown to expect more from your company.  I will continue to buy your brand, but will pay more attention to what i\\'m buying. I had to send the first pair back. A piece of the sole ripped off after only a few wears and my son only wore them to school. I did reorder them bc my son loved the look, and said they were comfortable. So just hoping it was a fluke.  Nope, they didn\\'t hold up.  Don\\'t waste your money. This is my second time buying a pair of Reeboks for my kindergartner. They look great and fit well. The only trouble is the listing is confused so I received the ALT model instead of the model that is described. I can\\'t speak to the quality since we sent these back.  The picture and description led me to believe the shoes were lace up shoes.  I ordered a size 1 and when they arrived they were a velcro closure which is not what we were looking for.  Otherwise it was a nice looking shoe. my child loves these and the black and red color. comfortable sneaker, great price. Hard to review a shoe.Wearing them as I\\'m writing this.  Super comfortable. Perfect for walking, gym, everyday.Will get soaked in the rain, obviously.Easy to clean and dry. Amazing shoes and fit perfectly. Light weight, good traction, and overall great price (I got them for half price). These shoes are a hit or miss. I bought two pairs, and it seemed the two pairs were different. Although the underlying shape was the same, the sole on one of them was grey and the other was white. Also, the 10.5 size was somehow bigger than the size 11, to our confusion. The shoes is also very similar to mens sizing, as opposed to womens sizing, which is also very confusing. Love these. A bit lightweight so can not imagine they would last long if you actually wore them running. I use them for casual day to day use. These are great light running shoes at a very good price. Excelente producto, tal y como se describe, excelente calidad, comodidad y tiempo de entrega Love them Fits a little bigger than I expected but they are extremely comfortable IL FAUT PRENDRE1 Ã\\x80 2 POINTS PLUS PETITS. At least half size down, itâ\\x80\\x99s too big These shoes are super comfortable and really cute.  Best purchase ever!  They fit true to size. I find this shoe to be very comfortable. I bought them due to having joint (foot and knees) problems. I do have a challenge in getting them on as fit nice and snug to prevent the foot from slipping around. A zipper up the front would be nice. And yes, i will buy them again. We got what we wanted - a sensible, comfortable, no-nonsense pair of shoes - no fashion statement but  just right for walking and not tripping, running and not slipping, hopping and never skipping. This product actually is making my plantar faciaitis better after 6 mons of pain. Like walking on baloons...very happy The shoes look good, feel good. It is just that when I wear shoes all day they have to be soft because my toes will hurt. The shoes are soft and because they are new I need to work them in. They are so comfortable  and I love the colour.  Very good product.  ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Great sneaker. I have problems with plantar fasciitis. Great walking shoe. This shoe doesnt come in half sizes. I bought 2. The smaller one is too small and the larger is too large. Both very uncomfortable bc of this. A shame for an attractive shoe. Gift to granddaughter says fit and feel great all day I bought this for my daughter and she loves it so much!Very comfortable, feel good on your feet and the color pink is very attractive. These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  Snug around the heel and lots of room.  So far I don\\'t have any foot pain.  Would definitely recommend The sizing chart is wierd because it\\'s Unisex Sizing. My foot is 9\"x3\" and according to the listing\\'s size chart, I should order a Men\\'s 5/Woman\\'s 6. However, I\\'m a US Woman\\'s Size 7/7.5 and can wear a Men\\'s 5.5/6.Since this seller offers free returns, I went ahead and ordered the recommended Size 6 (in case the sizes were Men\\'s) and a Size 7 (in case the sizes were Woman\\'s) so I could compare fit.The Size 6 was too snug and short. The Size 7 fits well, lengthwise but is a tad wide. I kept the 7 because I wear socks and wanted to use an insole for plantars fasciitis. The shoes do not come in a box, they come in a nice little bag - which makes them perfect for Returing the Size 6 was as easy as taking the unpacked shoe bag to Kohl\\'s (although, since I have a printer, I chose to drop it off at UPS in the original reusable Amazon bag).A previous reviewer mentioned that they broke their ankle wearing these shoes. I can see how that could happen because the 3D-Knit weave of this particular shoe is very pliable and soft. Literally, the shoe upper feels like a loose fitting sock your Grandma might crochet. The collar of the shoe is so flimsy, a hard kick would likely send the shoe flying off your foot. So, it is impossible for me to imagine anyone running in this shoe or walking faster than 10-15 mins per mile. There simply is not enough structure to the body of the shoe for any type of performance activity. These shoes are not in the same league and will not perform at anywhere near the same level as Adidas Primeknit, Nike Flyknit or similar type of slip-on sneakers.However, it\\'s a very comfortable, light weight shoe and perfect for casual wear and short walks. It is a great grab and go shoe and, unlike the higher end brands names, I find these to be convenient airport security shoes because they are incredibly easy on/easy off and won\\'t make me a target for theft as I leave the airport or check into a hotel.The listing photos do not so the shoe justice. They are cute, fashionable and comfortable. I say this as a person who owns over 100 shoes at or near the $150 price point.If you plan on doing a lot of walking (over 5 miles), I\\'d recommend getting a good orthotics insole for arch support and heel impact (or wear a performance walking shoe instead). That being said, I recommend these Sneakers as a low-cost option for travel because they are light weight, great for casual walking, easy to pack, and perfect for security check points.NOTE: I was NOT compensated in any way for my review. I paid full price for the pair I\\'m wearing in the photo. I think some of the other reviews may be fake so I wanted to add a comprehensive and honest review. There\\'s nothing I dislike about these shoes. I haven\\'t had shoes this comfortable in years. I am a size 9 and that\\'s what I ordered and the fit is perfect. I\\'ve been wearing them daily for hours and these shoes are the best comfort of any expensive shoe I\\'ve purchased in the past.  I\\'m elated and thanks for supplying an affordable comfortable shoe! These are super fun looking shoes. People ask me about them every time I wear them. Most of the upper shoe is knit-like and airy and really comfortable. However there\\'s also too much slippage in the toebox and my feet roll to the inside with each step. I wouldn\\'t wear these if I needed to do much walking, but for average wear they\\'re ok. They\\'re fun and colorful and I hope they last long enough for me to get over them. Lol. I ordered  my actual size, but turns out a half-size smaller might\\'ve been better. I don\\'t think that would\\'ve improved the pronation though. Just getting started with these! Love it!! Really nice option for running and athletics. Might want to add gels, but I need a softer foot-bed. Upper is a little extra pliable and less secure than the old-school toebox, but the quality is fight on par with all the top brands of similar design. Truly Excellent sneaker, they are very well made and extremely comfortable. If you have any foot problems these are your answer ,They give to accommodate most foot issues. They are extremely lightweight and I bought the Multi/Color which is truly an eye catcher. Do not pass these up ! This is great shoes very comfortable and very lightweight. It is really good for walking and running. Its ture size and great value. Its breathable and can wear them all day and never get sweating feet. I recommend this shoes. I bought these as a birthday gift for my hubby. He loves them and wears them all the time. Lightweight and comfortable. One of the shoes is angled awkwardly making me walk off my gait. Makes me walk with my foot leaning inward as if I have no arch. I waited too long to return them, so they\\'re going in the trash I really liked the quality of this pair of shoes, great color too. Awesome price. The shoes feel real comfortable too. I got a half size larger and it works perfectly, i hate wearing shows so this is close as i get with out having to wear flip flops. Zapatos cÃ³modos y bonitos. Desde q llegaron mi niÃ±a solo quiere ponerse esos. Tallan correcto y quedan muy guapos puestos.

I thought it was a flat sporty boot. It does fit on the large size. I should have gone half size down. Will keep them anyway. Really happy with these - they are very cute and exactly what I wanted. I like to get an extra 2-3â\\x80\\x9d in a hidden wedge if possible!One note - the soft furry lining that you see coming out at the top of the shoe only goes down about an inch inside. The heel area and inside of the shoe is NOT lined with it. it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t bother me really, but the picture makes it seem like itâ\\x80\\x99s lined when itâ\\x80\\x99s not. I tested the shoes in the rain today and they felt great! They kept my feet warm and dry the whole time! They are also comfortable. I live in NYC so I walk everywhere all day long. I was looking for a stylish pair of waterproof sneaker shoes and they are perfect! Though they are not fully lined with faux fur they have a bit of fur trim around the ankle which feels pretty good. I will definitely buy more shoes from this company. I am very satisfied with the product. Loved the look of this sneaker/boot...functional yet stylish and that\\'s exactly how it looks when wearing it. Really like the zippers on each side that makes it so easy to get them on and off. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable, yet not heavy, boot for cold weather. They are really cute but not super comfortable. I am size 7 and 6.5 was to big I to order size 6 it fits as expected.. but the sole is really uncomfortable.. You got Grego she like them the Color was ok yet if they were Blond tiny bit mo Fur eighter inside if not Outside they would of been loved Super cute and really comfortable. Something I\\'ve been looking for. Love the look for these boots, but not super comfortable and very narrow, my suggestion order up a half size and in wide My daughter absolutely loves them.  They fit just perfect My mom enjoys her shoes. Easy to put on and fasten the straps THIS WAS A GREAT BUY. I PURCHASED THESE FOR MY GRANDMOTHER. WE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING SHOES BECAUSE OF THE SWELLING IN HER FEET WHICH CAUSED HER TO BE UNBALANCED. WE TRIED NEW BALANCE AND OTHER BRANDS. WHEN SHE TRIED THESE ON SHE SAID THEY FEEL GOOD THE WIDTH COMFORT AND THE SOFTNESS OR THE SHOE AND ABLITY TO ADJUST THE STRAP WAS GREAT. NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM ESP FOR PEOPLE WITH FEET ISSUES Got a great fit and didn\\'t have to be hassled by traffic! Schuhe statt beige, habe in grau erhalten.. Absolut vielseitiger Schuh These were great but they rubbed my ankles and my upper heal real bad. I got my full return and ordered the facet 60 low. They cut better around my ankle. These would be great for anyone who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have a hard time with a high top shoe. Riktigt snygga skor, dessvÃ¤rre stora i storleken.

Wrinkles on the upper leather (especially at the heel), loose elastic band, and dirt at the sole with worn marks (see the second picture lower right). Disappointed. It fits my husband perfectly. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Iâ\\x80\\x98ll be able to get him to wear another brand. When his new ones start to look old, I get him a new pair. This pair is one of his Christmas presents! Really like these shoes from SAS. Ordered them in an extremely hard to find size : 14 AA ( slim ) . They look and fit great. Highly recommend these American made shoes. I dont know what it is but its not comfortable. I have been buying the white leather of the same model which is very comfortable so I thought a change might be nice but no Extremely comfortable. I have wide feet and flat feet. These shoes fit well and re not tight and are very comfortable!  I\\'ve had them for a out 2 months and they are great. Made in the USA is important too! Am a repeat buyer of SAS shoes, very comfortable and durable shoes worth the money This is my husbands second pair.  He loves them.  Very comfortable.  Wear well.  He had a pair he has worn every day for two years and they still look very good.  I bought these as a spare pair. Best shoe ever!! I walk miles eash up and down the halls. I work in a Children\\'s hospital, so my shoes take a beating. The last pair lasted for 2 years. Nike and Adidas I had to buy every 4-5 months. Thank You San Antonio Shoes! Great shoes. Comfortable right out of box. Excellent workmanship. Happy made in USA. This is the third set of these sneakers that my husband has bought.  His foot pain went away instantly.  His podiatrist recommended he stick with SAS too. This is my third pair of SAS Journey Mesh Sneakers.  The feel is very nice and they are very durable.  The best shoe I\\'ve owned.  The big plus is that they are made in the USA. Really confortable, I wear them as slippers...I ordered a size 5 as I usually wear 6 but I saw that it was men\\'s size. Fits perfect! I love these, you can tell that it is a quality product. Brilliant. Love them. So comfy! Not woman It\\'s definitely not soft.I bought it since it said in the product description. But it\\'s not soft TrÃ¨s bonne Best sandals, amazingly comfortable. So confortable! Exactly what I expected!

Die Stiefel weisen Abriebspuren auf und der Staub vom tragen des Vorbesitzers haftete noch an. Eine UnverschÃ¤mtheit! I rant and rave to all my friends about these shoes! They are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought. Iâ\\x80\\x99m an orthodontic technician so Iâ\\x80\\x99m constantly up and down on and off my feet for 10+ hours a day depending on the day. I have never had a pair of shoes that helped my feet, legs, and back from hurting after a long shift till I bought these. Best part is I bought a second pair for my everyday shoes also! â\\x80\\x9cMy New Lightweight Sneakers â\\x80\\x9c I a size 8 Medium, I received these today, I tried the shoes on, the shoes have nice arch support, lightweight, comfortable, nice mauve color, I bought a size 8, my shoes fit true to size, I will purchase another pair in the future, the sneakers also make nice house slippers, also have minimal stretch, I received a nice compliment on my shoes.ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a I got these to wear around the house instead of going barefoot on the hardwood. They are very comfortable and cute. For my purposes I had hoped they would slip on and off a bit easier. I still have to lean down to get the heel straightened out. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t worn them out but I think they would be fine. I almost forgot I was wearing shoes because my feet get so much air when I wear these. It\\'s been over 90Â° where I live and I wore these without any socks...when I took my shoes off my feet were COMPLETELY dry & not sweaty at all. They are so comfortable and flexible. Also standing for long periods have been easier. I just ordered 4 more pair.l, one for my mom, my daughter & two more for yours truly. Very happy. These seemed to be made fairly decent, may even wear well, but while the fit was OK in length and the width seemed good they were too tight on my feet.After wearing them for a few minutes it became uncomfortabe and I had to remove them.Glad I only wore them indoors on carpet so I was able to return them. Very tight. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a shoe stretcher in for days and my feet still start to hurt within the first hour of wearing these. A shame because they are very lightweight and something Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to wear daily. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll keep trying to stretch them out!! Los tenis son super cÃ³modos y de un peso ligero. Lo Ãºnico en lo cual no estoy muy satisfecha es en las condiciones en las que llegaron.

Great shoes.  Buy bigger6.5 is 37! Too small .  Returned.7 is 37 ! Wow.  Too small. Returned.  What do I need to order to get a 38?? I have a hard time finding cute shoes in a size 13. Happy to find theseâ\\x80\\x94cute and comfortable While I hate sneakers, I knew I would need something comfortable for our upcoming vacation, lots of walking every day. Ordered these recently and I am in love. I usually go barefoot at home but these are so nice in my feet I keep them on even at home! I thought I\\'d have to break them in but honestly they feel like they were made for my feet and I find myself styling my outfits so I can wear them! Super, super comfortable and cute! Excelentes tenis y la calidad y precio sÃºper convenientes. CÃ³modos, suaves, bonito color. A mi hijo le encantaron y se los puso de inmediato. Los recomiendo. Bungee laces which are awesome. Fits as expected. Excelente  calidad, durabilidad y muy bien en relaciÃ³n precio producto Llegaron bien y antes de la fecha Our 11 year old has big feet! LOL!  Had trouble finding shoes wide enough.  I know that New Balance is a good brand, and have worn them myself before.  They are not expensive Adidas and Nike - which all our shoe store seems to want to carry - both Adidas and Nike were not wide enough - he was wearing a pair of Nike\\'s and having a lot of issues with his feet hurting when we would go for our morning walk.  These don\\'t hurt his feet and they are good solid comfortable shoes.  It\\'s important to have good shoes that fit for your child...and they you want to be as cost effective as possible because they need a new pair every 6 months.  You don\\'t want to buy a brand that\\'s going to fall apart or not provide any support from a cheap big box store.  So try these!  Especially if your child has a wide foot.  I don\\'t care for the red - but he likes red. These arrived as described. They were cute and easy for my four-year-old to slip on and off by himself. He has wide feet, but these fit true to size and he says they are comfortable. I am really disappointed with the quality. He\\'s been wearing them for three weeks and they are already starting to fall apart! The entire family usually wears New Balance because of quality and comfort. I\\'ve never had a pair feel this cheap. I\\'m honestly wondering if they are knockoffs? I love these, for myself. A great deal for women buying childrenâ\\x80\\x99s sizes. A 5.5 is a womanâ\\x80\\x99s size 7. I also like that I can just pull on, the faux laces are awesome. However if you are wide width as I am, consider a regular. New Balance seems to run wide to begin with and this is the 3rd pair I have wished I had gotten regular width in... These shoes are very vibrantly. My son said they were comfortable. He usually wears a size 6 but after reading reviews I went with a 7 and they fit him good. The price was reasonably priced, an overall a good buy. I will be purchasing more colors. These shoes look nice, but they are regular tie laces, not bungee laces.  See photo. I also sized up, based on other reviews, and they are way too big.  These definitely run true to size. I bought these sneakers for my 4th grader to wear to camp. He was so happy not to be bothered with tying and untying his shoes all the time. They are so comfortable too, I\\'m planning on buying a pair for myself.  These sneakers give the support needed with laces but the ease of a slip on shoe. My son did say that if moves a certain way then sometimes his foot will fall out of the shoe, but this is true if the laces are loose as well. horrible, uncomfortable Bought these for my 85 year young mother in law.  She loves them .  Stylish, comfortable, well made , secure footing and reasonable priced.  She loves them. Love these! Go with just about everything.

They\\'re way too big and large for the regular Clarks Size Chart I used to buy. My husband brought a 10.5 W pair, wich is his regular size in this particular shoe brand and they were way too big, like 1.5 bigger size. Then I decided to order the shoes again in a Smaller size (10 W), cause he actually like this model so much, and as you can see in the picture they were exactly the same size, even that we I ordered it half size smaller. I\\'m really disappointed cause my husband has tons of Clarks Shoes and this is the first time this happen, maybe because I didn\\'t buy the in the store. If you are gonna buy them choose them 1.5 smaller size. I liked these even though they are more blue than I expected.  But I had to return them because they are sized pretty small.  The length was close to the proper size but the width was definitely narrow. Unfortunately, they do not come in a wide version of my size. Very comfortable and good-looking shoes but the sizing are way off. Size 10.5 is more like size 11.5.-12 They look huge in comparison to my other similar type of shoes and are at least 1/4 inch longer. I had to return two pairs to get the right fit from size 10.5 to size 9! Muy bonitos y cÃ³modos. Super comfortable for my flat feet and true to size. I wear these to work a few times of week, they feel like tennis shoes! I will be buying at least another pair in another color. Nice shoes. Based off the reviews I ordered an 11 when normally my husband is a size 12-13. Perfect fit. Excelente calzado Fits well and looks great. The gray and white go well together. Most people never mention my shoes but these got a compliment. Love these shoes.  Clarkes fit me well and I was looking for casual above sneakers.  Very nice shoes.  comfortable  thx Spend 30 more dollars and get the original ones I love the look of this shoes and wanted them to fit so much.There is no room for the toesâ\\x80¦ I ordered a size bigger and my toes were still showing lol! I donâ\\x80\\x99t have fat toes Mejor de lo esperado y justo a tiempo la Entrega, perfecto embalaje Muy hermosos mejor que en foto, color bello, talla es justa Super nice quality shoes. The fabric is like a nylon. Love em Esta perfecto y cÃ³modo I\\'ve been hoping to get these sneakers for a while now, and when Sperry ran out, I turned to Amazon. The first thing I noticed, pulling the shoes out of the box, was a faint yellow stain on the right shoe and some yellowing in the laces. It really isn\\'t a big deal, since it kind of goes with the vintage vibe(ish) but when I tried the shoes on, they were SUPER wide in the front, and only in the front. In all fairness, I have really narrow feet, but my other pair of Sperry\\'s fit me perfectly fine so I\\'m not sure if they changed something up. Anyhow, the look of the shoes is fantastic, so that\\'s a plus. Very cute, comfortable and fits as expected. The sole is not too high either, for people that are used to flat shoes. Perfect Talla adecuada, buena calidad, son cÃ³modas. Las chanclas son perfectas, muy cÃ³modas. Guter Sitz, sehr leichtGrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe wie gewÃ¼nschtEmpfehlenswert Best shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve worn for volleyball the only concern is lack of cushion near the balls of the feet but besides that traction, lockdown, comfort, and design were perfect. If you play for 3+ hrs thatâ\\x80\\x99s when u begin to feel some soreness in your feet. For volleyball players this shoe Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend to setters and liberos/ds just because of response and reaction time was just much better with those I didnâ\\x80\\x99t worry about lag when it came to passing and stepping into a setting position for hitting its mediocre thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lack of ankle support and if ur a hitter that jumps often Iâ\\x80\\x99d say just watch out with the landing because thatâ\\x80\\x99s what prevented a full 5 stars. She absolutely loves these shoes Fit great Good but bigger and wider.. Love these. Been searching for ages for this colour and style. Perfect! I love these shoes!!  I am a nurse and am on my feet for 14+ hours.  These get me through the day without any problems!!  Love adidas and their torsion control line of shoes!! They feel amazing on my feet. I work 12 hours on concrete floors and my feet donâ\\x80\\x99t hurt. Der Sneaker sind wirklich toll aus und wirkte bequem.  Ich hÃ¤tte ihn gerne behalten und war etwas Hin-und hergerissen, aber: er roch so schlimm nach Chemie! Man bekam umgehend Kopfschmerzen. Ich habe mich dann entschlossen, soetwas nicht an den FÃ¼Ã\\x9fen tragen zu wollen. Schade eigentlich! WunderschÃ¶ner Schuh! Bequem und alles topLeider stÃ¶rt mich der weiÃ\\x9fe Stoff auf den Zehen, da dieser sehr sehr empfindlich ist. SchÃ¶nes und groÃ\\x9fartiges Design Ich behalte den Artikellg Doris Super! Passform perfekt und sie sind superleicht und bequem. Ich finde die Farbe wunderbar fÃ¼r den Sommer, intensiv aber nicht zu grell. (Ich wurde zwei mal von fremden, freundlichen jungen Frauen angesprochen, woher ich die Schuhe habe, das ist mir mit anderen Schuhen noch nicht passiert :) Dieser Schuh hat auf ganzer Linie enttÃ¤uscht! Leider muss man einen Stern geben! Vorne zu eng, hinten zu weit. Eine Passform, die ich noch bei keinem Schuh erlebt hab. Dazu kommt, dass das Material billig wirkt....ich habe einige Schuhe von adidas, so dass ich gute VergleichsmÃ¶glichkeiten habe. Die RÃ¼cksendung erfolgte problemlos (allerdings erst nach einem Telefonat mit dem sehr freundlichen und hilfsbereiten Anbieter hin kostenfrei) Einer meiner Lieblingsschuhe. Sehr leicht und mega bequem. Was mir nicht ganz gefiel war hinten der weiÃ\\x9fe Abschnitt mit der pinken adidas Aufschrift. Aber nun gut, da sehe ich gerne drÃ¼ber hinweg. Ich finde er sieht real besser aus als auf den Fotos. Der Versand ging Ã¼brigens blitzschnell! Das Material ist recht steif, so dauert es schon etwas lÃ¤nger bis der Schuh eingelaufen ist und anfangs kommt manein wenig schwer hinein. Etwas flexibleres Matwerial wÃ¤re hier besser.Die NÃ¤hte rundumwiesen keine MÃ¤ngel auch, das hatte ja ein anderer Rezensent geschrieben, hier zum GlÃ¼ck nicht. Die Schuhe wurden schnell im Karton verpackt geliefert und passen perfekt. Die Verarbeitung ist sauber und das Modell gÃ¼nstiger als im Laden. Dank der grauen Farbe passt der Sneaker zu jedem Outfit. Sehr bequemer Tragekomfort!! Son zapatillas de calle, no para hacer deporte. Son muy cÃ³modas, estÃ¡n bien acabadas y son muy bonitas. Yo he pedido el mismo nÃºmero que uso en zapato de calle y quedan perfectas. Finde den Schuh super, passt perfekt! Habe 38 und habe den Schuh in der GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe bestellt und der passt! Der Schuh ist super trage in Adidas LA Trainer GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 38 2/3 in Adidas Los Angeles 39 1/3 und in diesen brauch ich 40 Passt wie angegossen.Entspricht der angegebenen GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe.Form und Farbe sowie Material sind super.Schuh trÃ¤gt sich wunderbar. Super leichtes TragegefÃ¼hl. Muy guapas y comodas estan muy bien Meiner Tochter haben die Sandalen sofort gut gefallen und auch direkt gepasst. Sie lassen sich gut zu vielen KleidungsstÃ¼cken kombinieren. Das Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis stimmt.Leider sitzt die eine Ferse (womÃ¶glich durch die Riemenkonstruktion) oft schief im Schuh.Meine Tochter rockt Schuhe schnell herunter. Diesmal hat die Sohle bisher gut gehalten, dafÃ¼r schloss der Klettverschluss nicht mehr richtig. Ich habe daher die NÃ¤hte am Klettband abgetrennt und den Klettstoff mit Klettband aus dem Hobbymarkt ersetzt. Es war selbstklebendes Band. FestgenÃ¤ht habe ich es nicht noch einmal extra und es hÃ¤lt seit nunmehr 2 Wochen ohne Probleme und schlieÃ\\x9ft wieder gut. Je les ai achetÃ©es pour ma fille de 11 ans et demi, qui a le pied  fin , la marque possÃ¨de des modÃ¨les Ã\\xa0 scratch qui permettent de rÃ¨gler la sandale .  (les marques que je prenais habituellement  s\\'arrÃªtaient au 34-35 quand j\\'ai achetÃ© celles-ci, ou bien il n\\'y avait plus la pointure ou bien elles restaient trop chÃ¨res). PremiÃ¨re deception: les scratchs croisÃ©s de devant ne peuvent pas resserrer la sandale,  il n\\'y en a qu\\'un qui est scratchÃ©, celui en textile ne bouge pas et la sandale est faite pour un pied medium- large et pas fin,  par contre en longueur  elles sont  plutÃ´t courtes. Les sandales n\\'ont pas crÃ©e un attrait irrÃ©sistible, c\\'est vrai qu\\'elles sont confortables et la semelle est Ã©paisse et souple. Le problÃ¨me de ces sandales c\\'est qu\\'elles sont un hybride rÃ¢tÃ© entre la sandale classique et la sandale de marche .La partie en textile est malvenue et donne une impression \"tchip\", Le \"cuir\" ne couvre pas assez le pied pour le protÃ©ger et les couleurs sont peu sÃ©duisantes . Le prix de base est exagÃ©rÃ©ment Ã©levÃ©, le prix Amazon (46 euros) reste cher.Ce ne sont ni des GBB (pour la qualitÃ© et l\\'esthÃ©tisme) ni des geox pour le confort ou le cotÃ© sportif. Autant acheter un premier prix chez Decathlon.Au bout de mÃªme pas un mois, la partie textile est dÃ©jÃ\\xa0 bien sale et la sandale bien usÃ©e . wir hatten bereits das VorgÃ¤ngermodell. Dieses war weit besser verarbeitet und sah auch besser aus. Allein das Fussbett war besser - das Fussbett hier ist aus weissem Kunststoff!!! Ich habe den Schuh daher zurÃ¼ckgeschickt und das VorgÃ¤ngermodell gebraucht gekauft. sandali per ragazzina di ottima qualitÃ\\xa0, tutti in pelle, soletta morbida, suola rialzata e flessibile habe sie mittlerweile in 5 verschiedenen Farben und trage keine anderen Sandalen mehr... Wer einen hohen rist hat sollte eventuell eine GrÃ¶sse grÃ¶sser bestellen Sehr schÃ¶ne sandale QualitÃ¤tsuper,leider mur bis grÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 35 war fÃ¼r unsere Tochter zu knapp....schade Very comfortable and good quality Die Sandale ist noch nicht in Benutzung macht aber einen sehr guten Eindruck, Superfit halt. Ich finde, die Sandale fÃ¤llt eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer aus. Absolut ungeeignet fÃ¼r Kinder. Kein Halt, falsche FuÃ\\x9fstellung wird gefÃ¶rdert!. FÃ¼r den Preis unmÃ¶glicher Schuh! Sehr schÃ¶n Bought these for outdoor wear. I have purchased NB shoes in the past with no problem but I sent these back the same day I received them. I read the reviews re: tendency to run small. So I ordered a size larger (length) and instead of my usual 4E I ordered 6E.  Waaaay to tight. To the point it was ridiculous. Figured they gave me the wrong size. Nope. Right there on the label. When 1 person says they\\'re to tight, that\\'s one thing. When a dozen people say it, something is wrong. NB should be ashamed. I have big, fat, flat \"Fred Flintstone\" kind of feet.  On top of that, I\\'ve developed Plantar Fascitis  after 50 years of working on my feet.  I tried multiple boots and found no comfort.  For anyone with wide feet, you know its hard to find much selection for you, and it\\'s worse when you\\'re trying to find something comfortable too.  I measure that I should need a 10.5 EEE shoe.  I bought these in 11 / 6-E and I finally have some comfort !  So far I\\'ve worn them daily for 3 months and may have to replace the footbed inserts soon, but they have been the best boots I\\'ve worn in many years ! Bought these because they are one of the few \"wide\" shoes made with good ankle support. However, the design is not a good one for men with wide feet.  The tongue of the shoe is sewn to the sides (?), making it difficult to put the shoe on and uncomfortable across the top of the foot. It also is very narrow; I measured the sole of a size 11 6E against a pair of New Balance size 11D shoes and the difference in width was negligible.  The insole they put inside is actually too wide for the shoe itself.Just really bad execution of a great idea. Working a job where I\\'m on my feet for 90% of the time I needed a pair of boots that didn\\'t kill my feet, and these are the ones I found after a long search. I can wear these boots all day and not have any pain which is a first for me. I actually prefer to wear these as my every day foot wear now because they\\'re actually more comfortable than my regular shoes which is a mind blower. I wish they came in more colors though. Wide enough to fit comfortably. But just a little bigger than I need. The caveat: My feet are all kinds of chewed apart. My history includes: Paperboy, Baltimore, MD, from ages 8-14; Year-round athlete, ages 8-16; Landscaper, ages 13-18; Restaurant Staff, ages 16-19; Furniture Delivery/Truck Driver, ages 18- 25; Soldier, ages 25-34; Medical Staff, Multiple Services, ages 25-52 and beyond.......I think I need â\\x80\\x9cspecialized shoesâ\\x80\\x9d from now on. So, for my needs, EXCELLENT SHOE, over the counter. I need a prescription....... about 20 years ago.HU-AAAAAAAAHHHHHH.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?Thank you, New Balance, for the acknowledgment that WIDE FEET EXIST!!!!!!!Hello?....... EVERY other shoe brand - IN THE WORLD- !!!!!!!!  ?????PAY ATTENTION, dummy...!!!! I\\'m happy with the purchase, though next time, I might go up to the 6E instead of sticking with the 4E version. They seem to run a little narrow for my taste. Otherwise...they\\'re the real deal. I wear them to work and I pull 12 hour nights shifts at a hospital. I was looking for something that had really good support and were a good, solid, stable foundation to work off when moving patients. These do the trick. Poorly manufactured.  We purchased for our grandson and after he wore them 2-3 times the ankle area of the inner left boot ripped after he tripped over a branch!  So disappointed with this boot because we have other New Balance shoes and encountered no problems.  I hope we can return because it says the return window is closed! The leather is very thing and fragile, There is a rubber label on the tongue that gets bunched up so I removed them. The tongue of the show has to be sort of crunched into the shoe.Fortunately I got these for $45 as a used/like new item so I am overall happy. I,purchased these primarily because of the new balance name.  I am GREATLY disappointed.  The soles of the boots have separated from the rest of the shoe and this happened within first 6months of almost daily use.  I can not believe how poorly manufactured these are especially with the New Balance Name. Great except slippery on wet rocks packed snow and ice. Not a good winter sole Ich habe nur 4 Sterne von 5 vergeben, weil die Einlegesohle fest verklebt ist und orthopÃ¤dische Einlagen nicht mehr in den Schuh passen. Ich habe schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe und der Schuh hat mir perfekt gepaÃ\\x9ft. Aber er muÃ\\x9f 1 bis 1,5 SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt werden. Das Obermaterial ist sehr weich und gut verarbeitet. Zapatilla muy comoda , yo las uso para pasear y son comodisimas tallan justas por lo que hay que pedir una talla mas , las recomiendo. Me han gustado mucho. Son iguales que en las fotos. Yo uso una talla 42 y he cogido una 43,5.me quedan un pelin mÃ¡s grande,  pero no se nota nada. VolverÃ\\xada a comprarlas. Su precio me ha encantado.super cÃ³modas . Me encantan y muy buen precio Perfectas Buenas sensaciones son muy comodas,la talla es correcta.cuando pase un tiempo si son duraderas y resistentes les dare cinco estrellas. Gute Passform, bequem, passt wie erwartet.Wird als Alltagsschuh genutzt. Muy cÃ³modas! Y el tallaje bien. Quedan muy bien con la ropa, baratas y con calidad Perfect colour and good quality it\\'s the best s Very fine, very good ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Adidas quality at it\\'s best. I like the design and sole used in this shoe. My daughter uses it for when playing tennis and similarly with badminton. She feels the comfort and high quality that adidas is known for. It is difficult to get my fee into them and when I do, I feel like I have boats on. Love this shoe.  Helps keep good balance while playing tennis. Love ! Great foot stability! Shoes are comfortable, but they arenâ\\x80\\x99t even 2 months old and the design of the shoe is causing the material at the ankle to fatigue. It bends every step I take. Disappointing. PensÃ© que eran originales y de piel como los de adulto y me salieron clonados y de piel sintÃ©tica. My kid burns through shoes pretty fast. I\\'m now adding Kswiss to the list of name brand shoes that just aren\\'t made like they used to be. They survived about a month with medium wear. Do not recommend getting your 8 year old shoes that have cloth loops for laces. 2 of them ripped out and now my kid can\\'t tie them up. Had to drill holes in them to use for the laces and a decent pair of school shoes are now play shoes. Nice try KSwiss, you can go sit on the bench with the sketchers & adidas. Guess we will stick with Nike & Puma for awhile. I\\'m a big fan of the ST329 by K-swiss.  I\\'ve had 8 or 9 pairs over the last 11 years.  My son asked if they make them in his size.  Well whaddya know, they do!On the first day of kindergarten, my big boy got to wear the most comfortable sneakers he\\'s ever worn Grandson loves them .. They fit him very good. a bit too narrow, and or seems to run a bit small This is the second pair of these that I have purchased and my 13 year old loves them! Awesome quality fit perfect my son loves them I would definitely buy again Perfect my son loves them Absolutely love Appena arrivate, un giorno prima del previsto.Scarpe puma bianco in tela, come descrizione.Le ho soltanto provato,ho comprato il numero 42 e  sembra essere taglia corretta.Non ci ho ancora camminato su, se dovessi riscontrare qualche difetto aggiornerÃ² la recensione. Avevo aspettative molto alte sul prodotto . considerando le marca molto famosa nello sport, ma ho dovuto ricredermi. Qualita della plastica da migliorare, spero che riescano a resistere allo sport, considerando un assemblaggio non troppo perfetto. Klasse Produkt,macht was es soll.QualitÃ¤t ist wie bei den anderen Rezessionen Top.Super schnelle Lieferung, bin sehr zufrieden.Puma spricht fÃ¼r sehr gute QualitÃ¤t zum guten Preis El tiempo dirÃ¡ lo que me duran pero parecen robustas, sencillas y desde luego el precio es dificil de mejorar. Muy satisfecho. Le scarpe sono ottime per un uso soft tipo camminate anche a passo spedito o per un uso quotidiano. Tengono abbastanza bene la pioggia. Sconsiglio l\\'uso di queste scarpe per correre o attivitÃ\\xa0 fisica piÃ¹ impegnative. Nel compleso rimane un valido prodotto. Stanno benissimoâ\\x80¦.calzano bene..comode Bellissima colore e robustezza unica pecca veste grande consiglio di acquistare una taglia in meno Schuh sehr schÃ¶n, passt perfekt. Muy suave  ...perfecto It is very uncomfortable shoes - I doubt itâ\\x80\\x99s organelle or notInfact will write to Puma to look into Calidad esperada de una marca como Adidas. SÃºper cÃ³modos. Muy buena compra a un precio accesible Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had these shoes for about a month now and Really loving them! As far as I can tell these are legit Adidas! They are comfy and so cute. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not really a runner, I bought these shoes mostly for style but i gotta say I never realized how much a shoe matters in running until I bought these. Definitely good for running. They have like a honeycomb sole at the ball and heel of the shoe to lessen impact. Like I said super comfy!I have noticed the shoe lace issue some reviews mentioned but nothing a little double knot canâ\\x80\\x99t fix.All in all, I love these shoes!! I had a new pair of these and my college D1 athlete came home due to the quarantine - sheâ\\x80\\x99s a swimmer - suddenly turned runner, she swiped my shoes.  Took me a while to find the exact shoe but I did and now I have my running shoes back.  Very hard to purchase shoes when you canâ\\x80\\x99t try them on.  These shoes have a soft upper that does not rub or irritate and they have a soft wide heel for the trail running I like.  They are a bit heavy but that is because the heel is solid.  The laces are a bit odd for a runner but once adjusted the upper combined with the shock absorption of the soul of the shoe makes it worth the time.  I have a narrow heel and it slips if not tied properly.  I am a size 10 and I have enough room in the toe for long runs. I was so excited to find one if my fav shoes in stock, since I\\'m pretty sure its been discontinued. Unfortunately, they arrived USED with some pretty gross looking unidentifiable crud on the bottom of the shoes. I uploaded pics but they don\\'t really pic up the texture. My closest guesses to what was on the bottom is dried mud, paper mache, and spider webs. The shoe packing that normally goes inside new shoes was missing too. I\\'m so bummed I should\\'ve known it was too good to be true :( First of all I was so surprised how quickly these arrived considering the virus crisis, which says great things about this seller! I was really happy to get them so fast because I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t really start my marathon training program until I had the shoes.As for the product itself,  this is my second pair of pure boost go, & they are great for long distance runs. Lots of cushion & my last pair didnâ\\x80\\x99t give out on me until after 9 months of very heavy use. Iâ\\x80\\x99m still able to use my last pair  for waking & shorter runs (but can feel it in my feet & knees that they are on their way out) so Iâ\\x80\\x99m rotating the new pair in for the high mileage runs.I can recommend both seller & shoes Order 1/2 size down.  Absolutely one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased.. Updated: after finally breaking these shoes in (it took longer than expected), I changed my review from 1 star to 4. I still think the ultra boosts are better and have an extra bounce but overall these shoes are quite comfortable and great for running and walking.Original review: I decided to try the pureboost for a walking shoe since I absolutely love my adidas ultraboosts (I have had six pairs for running). I assumed they would be similar but they are not at all. I wore them out for a 5 mile walk and they destroyed the back of my heel. The shoes are not comfortable. If you are between these and the ultraboosts i highly recommend spending the extra money to get the ultraboosts. They are the most comfortable running/walking shoe i have ever had and worth every penny. This shoe was way too large. I have always ordered my running shoes a full size larger. Did the same with these shows but they were so large they looked like clown shoes. Sent them back immediately. Light weight shoe, but great shoe! Super comfortable for walking or running. Great for normal to wide feet. May run a half size bigger for skinny feet. Would recommend and purchase again! Anni fa comprai le mizuno wave 17, ad dir poco eccezionali oltre che comode.Presi il numero 45 e mi trovai veramente bene.Oggi dopo tanti anni ho avevo deciso di prendere un paio nuovo,purtroppo mi sono reso conto che le 45 non mi vanno piu\\'... adesso ho negli anni le misurazioni delle scarpe sono cambiate, oppure mi Ã¨ cresciuto il piede... pero\\' ho i miei dubbi che a 47 anni ci sia questa possibilitÃ\\xa0.Inoltre le scarpe sopra indicate, erano un po\\' durine, sul pavimento non avevano quella leggerezza che ricordavo.In ogni caso le ho restituite prendendo un altro modello della mizuno, ma stavolta il 46 The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0Ayant facilement des douleurs aux genoux, j\\'Ã©tais Ã\\xa0 la recherche d\\'une chaussure confortable et polyvalente Ã\\xa0 un prix abordable. Sur recommandation d\\'un collÃ¨gue expert en la matiÃ¨re, j\\'ai choisi ce modÃ¨le et je dois dire que les premiers essais sont trÃ¨s intÃ©ressants !On a l\\'impression de chausser des pantoufles, trÃ¨s confortables mÃªme si l\\'Ã©paisseur de la semelle sous le bout du pied semble trÃ¨s fine, on oublie ce dÃ©tail en courant.L\\'arriÃ¨re, bien plus Ã©pais, propose un trÃ¨s bon amorti mais qui reste stable pour autant. Elle est dynamique avec un arrondi qui fait gagner en confort. L\\'Ã©nergie se disperse bien.J\\'Ã©tais avant sur une chaussure Ã\\xa0 la semelle plate (hors grip) et la forme prÃ©sente sur ce type de modÃ¨le reprÃ©sente un vrai agrÃ©ment.On sent un peu l\\'effet ressort Ã\\xa0 chaque foulÃ©e et Ã§a donne envie d\\'aller plus vite et plus loin.La pointure correspond aux autres marques, ne taille ni trop petit ni trop grand.Je recommande cette paire et si cet avis vous aide Ã\\xa0 vous dÃ©cider, n\\'hÃ©sitez pas Ã\\xa0 cliquer sur le bouton utile ci dessous. Il prodotto Ã¨ arrivato con un giorno di anticipo e perfettamente impacchettato. Da anni compro Mizuno Paradox ma non trovandole piÃ¹ al prezzo precedente, ho comprato questo modello. Provate oggi. Come desiderato le ho trovate molto antipronazione al punto che al momento ho deciso di non inserire le mie solette ortopediche. Spero che rispetto alle Paradox, siano un poâ\\x80\\x99 piÃ¹ robuste sulla punta perchÃ© nonostante le abbia sempre rinforzate  con una pezza di cuoio leggero allâ\\x80\\x99interno, in passato le ho sempre bucate  in 6 mesi Premetto che le ho prese perchÃ© felice possessore delle wave 3. Vengo da un paio di adidas troppo morbide che mi hanno frantumato un menisco. Queste sono abbastanza dure. PerÃ² a mio avviso sono brutte. Ci devo solo andare a correre per cui ci passo sopra. Chiaramente dipende da come calzano sul proprio piede, ma io che non sono una piuma ed ho la pianta del piede larga trovo che queste siano tra le migliori come calzabilitÃ\\xa0 e stabilitÃ\\xa0 che danno Prodotto di ottima fattura, vestibilitÃ\\xa0 nella norma. Aiuta la corsa per chi ha falcata da pronatore. Consigliato! Misura giusta, ma sembrano piÃ¹ piccole del modello che avevo in precedenza. mi dovete scusare il pacco Ã¨ arrivato, l\\'Ã¬ha prrso un mio vicino di casa, ma Ã¨ tornato solo ora da lavoro e me \\'lha portato, io non potevo sapere di questa cosa...son passate tre ore e che ne so...scusate tutto apposto Mizuno Wave Equate 5, Scarpe per Jogging fantastiche e comodissime Sono comode e rapporto prezzo qualitÃ\\xa0 Ã¨ eccellente Great pair of sandals! Fit well exactly as expected, has an \"airy\" design and is very comfortable too. ...if you have a high instep. Like many shoe companies now, Skechers skimps on Velcro, saving a fraction of a cent, but making the shoes unwearable unless you have low-profile feet. Yet at the same time, there\\'s way more Velcro than would ever be needed on the heel strap.There are also prominent ridges across the sandals separating the toes from the rest of the foot, as well as another ridge between the large toe and the remaining toes. So, unless you have perfectly average feet, you may find those uncomfortable.The relaxed fit is a nice idea, just poorly executed in lacking sufficient Velcro. Skechers is my favorite brand My son loves these shoes. They are comfortable and fit well. My son tends to be particular about how his shoes fit and he loves these. We have bought several pairs as he grows. He is on pair #3 just due to growing into bigger sizes. They seem to wear down as expected. He wears the shoes everyday and is rough on them, but they hold up. Over time they do start show some of the wear and tear, but not more than expected based on his use. Second pair of these. They donâ\\x80\\x99t scuff easy like some of the cheaper tennis shoes for toddlers. They are sturdy and fit well. Unfortunately the sole comes right out so if you have a kid that likes to take off their shoes you could find one sole mysteriously disappears during daycare one day. Under the sole is rock hard so you canâ\\x80\\x99t continue wearing them unless you can find a similar replacement sole. Espectacular,son una pasada,me han encantado,de talla ideal,yo uso un 38 y me quedan bien,son super cÃ³modas,yo me las he puesto con vaqueros y me chiflan como quedan,tambiÃ©n tengo el modelo rapla en blanco,y espectacular tambiÃ©n,estoy encantada con esta marca.Me las habÃ\\xada recomendado una amiga y la verdad que las doy un 10. Absolutely love these shoes for my toddler! My son is 3 and just outgrew his size 9 adidas shoes - i went for these because the price was right and i know he is comfy in this brand/style. Great buy and i know they will last well! Me han encantado!! SuperÃ³ mis expectativas! Muy contenta con la compra.Lo que si me las noto un pelin grandecitas I got these for my son as his first \"real\" shoes.  They were a great fit and stayed on very well.  He did not seem to mind these as much as he did his other baby shoes.  The color of these was nice and complimented a lot of things.  The Velcro worked well and held the shoes on even when he tried to pull them off.  The inside felt cushioned and the shoes were easy to bend. Preciosas me encantan y quedan super bien , comodÃ\\xadsimas!, es el tercer par de esta marca y nunca decepcionaGracias Gioseppo ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8d Great shoe. My infant girl wears a size 2 and it fits her perfectly and there is enough width for her foot to feel comfortable. The style is super cute too. Kedan genial My four year old has a few options in this brand and these are my favorites. They wipe down rather easy and are adorable. My child can get them on her feet and wears them without complaining.  I like that the coloring has a sweet feminine touch to it.  Packaging was great and they arrived quickly using Amazon Prime. Son muy cÃ³modos, vienen bien de talla, y son mucho mÃ¡s guapos de lo que se ven en la foto Disappointed in these. Size runs very small and inside space where foot goes is very short. Also description says grey with hint of blue but they are grey and lilac purple. Returned. Perfecto I love this shoes.  They look so nice on my son and as others have commented they are so easy to keep clean!!! Even after spending time on the playground with dirt and mud ... a quick rinse and wipe and they look new.  I love them. Quedan perfectos y muy buena calidad I am so disappointed.These shoes arenâ\\x80\\x99t cheap for a 2 year old and less than 1 month into use (we have 5 pairs of shoes we rotate use of regularly in the same size) the stitching at the toe has come undone and there is a big hole. Me quedan perfectas My kid has pancake feet, so I really have to shop around to get his kicks just right. These are lightweight, comfortable, and not obnoxious. The price was fantastic as well. I would definitely buy these again in a different color. Muy bien I wrote an earlier review giving these shoes 4 stars. I\\'m changing that to 2. I\\'m giving them a 2 because they are comfortable as walking shoes. The reason for the demotion is due to the mesh material they are subject to getting holes in them which is poor construction, so my earlier praise is gone. I was getting out of my car and bumped the door with my foot resulting in a small hole in the shoe at the toe. Nothing you can do to fix it. So now water comes in and you can see your foot or sock if white. I missed the return date by one day. Too much money to get holes in them. You shouldn\\'t go around being afraid of your shoe getting holes. New Balance should know better and so should I. I wanted to try these and was a skosh wary because they\\'re used, but desc says like new, and Amazon is the seller, so what could go wrong, right? Received in a FLASH! Wooo - got here in one day, and I put \\'em on (with a shoe horn) and wore \\'em to a meeting last night. Plenty confy, and they look pretty good.  My bride was surprised I\\'d buy blue shoes, let alone WEAR them!?!?! Stylin\\' R Me.As to used - one shoe has a crimp where the big toe goes, and a spot with what could be a very light stain. Bottoms don\\'t look like they\\'ve been worn much. The crimp worried me, but I didn\\'t feel it at all, and they\\'re really \"grippy\" on the floors. So far, so good. And I can return \\'em if something turns up. For $40 quite pleased. Longtime NB wearer, never had tried this particular style...given my longstanding history of being very pleased with NB (not to mention the price!) I bought them and have been fairly pleased.They are super comfy and possess all the aspects of NB that I have grown accustomed to...but they fit a little strange. Im a dude with a small-ish foot (size nine) but that usually is a perfect fit with NB, but these arrived and they seem to run a little big, my foot slides around a bit more in these than other NB shoes for some reason. I dunno. I like em enough (i work as a nurse) so being on my feet for 12 hours a shift they are still super comfortable and I\\'ve just gotten used to the larger fitting size. I was looking for a comfortable show that can be worn around the house and for short trips to the market or shops. This one is perfect. Very comfortable sole and structure. Does not fell sloppy and holds foot firmly but gently in place. New Balance makes great shoes and these are no exception. Very good quality and all the details are properly done. Description of width was confusing requiring me to buy at a slightly higher price with free return.  Width is fine and comparatively easy to make small adjustments using laces. Shoe specified slip on construction. Maybe I am too literal but I thought this meant the shoe just slipped on and did not have laces to tie. The picture made it look similar to other shoes that have the lace look but no actual shoe lace to tie. This is not the case. I am sure these are perfectly fine sneaker but not for someone who does not have the dexterity to ties a shoe. Not quite as wide as I expected for a wide, and itâ\\x80\\x99s difficult getting my feet into because the opening is a bit small, but once theyâ\\x80\\x99re on, omg are these shoes comfortable!  Itâ\\x80\\x99s like wearing supportive slippers that are socially acceptable.  My feet are very grateful I bought these! The material at the toe of the shoe is very loose and stretchy.  As I ran, my feet from my arch forward felt too loose.  In fact, my toes crept forward over the outline of the sole of the shoe and were making contact with the ground with only the mesh as a barrier.  Tightening my laces did not help the issue.  For me, these shoes are useless for any type of exercise.  They\\'ve already been demoted to dog walking shoes (in this new role, they do fine). Great running shoe - only annoying thing is the shoelaces come untied when running. Get a new pair of laces or double knot I love Amazon for shoes my size (15D).  New Balance always fits me well, and these were priced so well I had to get a pair.  These shoes are perfect! Pensavo che stavo acquistando i soliti stivaletti ma la fattura e i materiali mi hanno lasciato senza parole. Sono \"tecnici\" ma allo stesso tempo eleganti senza tempo. Non temono freddo e pioggia. Comodissimi. Cercate di chiuderle cosÃ¬ che la cerniera non dia fastidio. Dopo qualche volta capirete come vi vestono meglio. La scarpa Ã¨ molto bella, purtroppo mi Ã¨ arrivata un numero piÃ¹ grande e la confezione lasciava molto a desiderare. Unica cosa positiva il prezzo scontato. Hacemos un pedido del 44,5; llega un 46. Al tramitar cambio, el precio se dispara. scarpa calda con il freddo e con pioggia piede asciutto. Absolutely waterproof, and stylish....perfect combination.  Got caught in a downpour and feet were loving the dryness.  Jeans were soaked but feet/socks were perfectly dry.  Great product. Ich habe die Schuhe fÃ¼r meinen Sohn fÃ¼r die Grundschule gekauft. Sie passen wie erwartet und haben einen schÃ¶nen Sitz. Es war mir wichtig, dass sie nicht rutschen, da Kinder ja gerne auch mal herumlaufen.Mein Sohn findet sie sehr bequem und trÃ¤gt sie gerne!

Also nichts fÃ¼r mich. Aber sehr schÃ¶ne Schuhe, aus Leder, Ã¤hnlich Hogan Perfetto Perfette MeEncantaron After this purchase I\\'m not sure I\\'ll purchase another pair of adidas with this pair being my first. The sneakers fit weird, as in the sizing. I am a 10 1/2- 11 in women. I has to order the sneaker three times and just gave up or in with a size 8 men. The sole has nice cushion, but the toes area doesn\\'t as much like the sneaker has an incline making it uncomfortable to walk in for a long period of time. The style and colors I love. Hope I didn\\'t confuse anyone maybe if it was in women sizes the fit would have been some what better but then again the sole is weird. Okay, Truth be told.. Originally found these Ultra Cool Adidas Ninja shoes at the \\'Adidas Outlet Store\" in Cabazon, CA. HOWEVER, They did NOT have my correct size & were not able to ever get again. So, looked for lowest price all over the Internet. Was happy to find on Amazon for a decent price & did not get upset considering the $88.00 cost at Outlet Store... All I can say is  Thank You!  They fit Perfectly!  Very comfortable & snug as a glove. Great Color too!!  Peace & ð\\x9f\\x92\\x96 Andrew J.ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a My husband had to have them for today and they arrived yesterday otherwise I would have returned them. They were very clearly a return as they were dirty inside including hair and one of the soles were out halfway and are super sticky on the underside so they are not supposed to be removed. Right from the get go put them on and wore them 8 hours. Even better than that orange/blue of the 2x foam I wear at work. If your knees are going out, like my knees, they are the shoes to wear.Adidas always seems to be a true fit for me , wearing a 9.5 Fits bigger than the other 4 pairs of Adidas mens 10s I own. Seems about a half size bigger. Love the appearance but one part of the hot pink is coming unglued after 2 days of wear. Super comfortable kicks and they look Awesome. There are no dislikes, every step is with cushion like feel. These have become my favorites. I never had shoes this comfy. Definitely buy another pair. Walking on clouds. I very highly recommend the Morrison3 sneaker. These fit great and true to size. They are comfortable and I like that they \"breathe\". I have had these in several colors and I am always thinking of additional colors that I would like to purchase. Saca ampollas I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus, swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on.  They were quite snug.  I assumed (my first mistake) that they would stretch, and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen.  So off came the tags and I wore them out.Unfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp.  In particular, the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point.  Since I now had $140 of unreturnable shoe, I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section. This let the liner stretch slightly, but not enough.  Even in my older, thinner orthotics and trouser socks, the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time.  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area, because they are unusable for me in their current fit.Clark shoes run a bit small and narrow, in my experience, so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width.  This portion fit as expected.  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support, these shoes might work for you.  The rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis; severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than these.TL;DR -- don\\'t buy if you wear custom orthotics, don\\'t buy if you pronate, don\\'t believe they will stretch when you try them on. These shoes felt a little snug when I first got them. I wore them around the house to make sure they were a good fit. I decided to take a chance on them and wear them the whole next day. They really adjusted well to my feet and I am pleased. I like that you can order Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s in a wide. I have a narrow foot and Clark\\'s usually fit perfectly, but these are tight and not adjustable because of the elastic band.  Super cute and well made. Too small so it feels too narrow â\\x98\\x86â\\x98\\x86â\\x98\\x86Want it Short and sweet???OK,LEATHER QUALITY:  EXCELLENTSOLE QUALITY: EXCELLENTLINING QUALITY:  VERY GOODDESIGN AND LOOKS:  VERY GOODBANG FOR THE BUCK:  VERY LOUD......!DURABILITY:  IT\\'S A HUSH PUPPIESI HAVE 4 PAIRS OF  HUSH PUPPIES, and have been wearing them for 3 years.  They will last 7 more years. No Problem. One of the eyelets came off, the first time I laced the shoes.  There is a flaw in the design. Poor quality. Cool boots The sole came detached after wearing these for 2 days only. Schuhe sind wie zu erwarten bequem und haben eine tolle Passform. Sind auch ziemlich leicht, also perfekt zum Sport machen. Die Farbe des Schuhe ist auch mit der Abbildung Ã¼bereinstimmend. Einen Minuspunkt gibt es zur Pflege, da die Schuhe sehr schnell stark verschmutzen, leiht aber generell am Material. Ich bin eigentlich Ã¼berhaupt kein Fan von Turnschuhen - sie sehen mir einfach immer viel zu klobig aus und unschÃ¶n.Aber diese hier sehen super schÃ¶n aus, sind mega bequem und stehen mir sehr gut. Ja, die Schuhe passen, sind aber nicht so schÃ¶n wie andere KangaROOS die ich besitze.Ziemlich klobiges Design, Preis war aber okay. Sehr empfindliches Obermaterial. Ich war mit allem sehr zufrieden und habe nichts zu beanstanden. ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d tolle Preisleitung!!!schuhe passen gut man lÃ¤uft prima drin und sie sind auch nicht empfindlich.bin Rundum zufrieden! FÃ¼r den Preis sehr gute Schuhe und bequem zu tragen Legere et souple Just received these shoes today, it was delivered earlier than usual. I have small feet a size 5 or 5.5 so I ordered a size 6. It was still tight so I am returning but what realllly bothered me was that itâ\\x80\\x99s yellow on parts of the shoe? Donâ\\x80\\x99t like that at all looks dirty already. I absolutely love these shoes! I\\'ve ordered 3 different pairs and wear them all the time! I prefer the canvas ones to the other kinds, they just feel a bit more comfortable. I\\'m on my feet almost all day and they never hurt when wearing these. I usually wear a 7 or 7.5 and these got perfectly. I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 tops so I ordered an 8.5 as the reviews suggested, and they fit perfectly. They are also thin like people say but I have skies for feet so wasn\\'t a problem for me. Not the comfiest but they look awesome. They are for show not going on hikes lol. White is really crisp. Got what I expected after the reviews and at this price point. Stark white sneakers will pretty much pull together any outfit - resulting in a classic, casual and effortless vibe.They are a must-have in my shoe collection. I prefer to re-buy cheap white fashion sneakers as white, well... doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really keep itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cwhite-out whiteâ\\x80\\x9d for very long.These shoes hold up very well. I use them strictly for fashion purposes, and are comfortable for that purpose. A little bit more sparkly than I was expecting... the photo of the rose gold lurex didn\\'t look sparkly to me in the picture but that\\'s okay because they\\'re still cute. I\\'m usually an 8.5 so I ordered an 8.5 and they fit perfectly. Love these shoes... They are a bit to big, would recommand half a point under, but I\\'ve correct it by adding a sole and they are perfect for work! Confortable and chic. Note that they are very shinny, but I didn\\'t mind they look great with jeans. I was unable to get the shoes on, they were so narrow, althoughI had ordered in my regular size.I would not recommend  this product They look great, just what I needed. I feel like they really need a cushioned insole or are uncomfortable, and they were a bit on the bigger side, but that is an easy fix. Very cute shoe. Fits a bit on the smaller side, would recommend ordering a half size up. For the price the product is good however the shoe has lower breathability compared to other brands, which makes it a good shoe for fashion but not if you are going out / walking for a long time. Love these, and the silver so sparkles,  unique,  bling bling.Comfortable and lightweight Muy buenos tenis The shoes were great but the box was completely destroyed. When I ordered the shoe it was from Adidas (Harden Vol 4), however it said in my order history that the shoe was Adidas Menâ\\x80\\x99s Crazy X 4 and it was sold by Shoe Cago. I was so confused and thought I was scammed. When I received the shoe I was expecting it to be some other adidas shoes but it turned out to be the Harden Vol 4. After doing research I found out that some other companies called the Harden Vol 4 â\\x80\\x9cCrazy X 4â\\x80\\x9d. I checked the shoes and theyâ\\x80\\x99re legit Harden Vol 4 but still they should fix this and make it clear if this is sold by Adidas or Shoe Cago and fix the name. Muy comodas, gran calidad, tienen buen ajuste, originales definitivamente. These shoes fit great and are stylish. Great purchase @ No se ve muy bien puesto, es muy ancho,se  ve mal Great color Awesome shoes look great quick to ship! I needed 1/2 size bigger I think. Really love the look. Bought it for my son, apparently there the current rage, good shoe but wish the made high tops Bad quality El color es increÃ\\xadble la talla es un poco justaSi eres de pie gordo no te lo recomiendo ya q  lo sentirÃ¡s muy ajustado y se deforma muy feoEn general buen tenisTiempo de entrega super rÃ¡pido Muy buenos tennis, le han aguantado a la persona que se los regale...

Merci Super cute, and very comfy.  My only complaint is I can not get my foot in with the tongue of the shoe getting pushed all the way up to the toe.  Thinking about trying to glue it down. ZunÃ¤chst vorneweg, der Schuh ist super, passt wie erwartet und ist komfortabel und schick. VerarbeitungsqualitÃ¤t lÃ¤sst keine WÃ¼nsche offen. D.h. der Schuh selbst verdient keine 1-Stern Bewertung, aber man kann nur das Produkt bewerten und nicht das Kauferlebnis selbst. Das ist ja grundsÃ¤tzlich bei Amazon hervorragend und ich bezeichne mich selbst eher als Amazon-Junkie als Amazon-Kunde, aber was diesmal mit der Prime-Wardrobe Bestellung passiert ist, ist denke ich eine Rezension wert, denn das geht gar nicht, weiÃ\\x9f nicht so recht wo der Fehler ist, das muss Amazon versuchen zu lÃ¶sen. Folgendes ist passiert: Sehe den Schuh zum sensationellen Preis von 79 EUR (bei Zalando war er deutlich teurer) und lege ihn in den Warenkorb. Es wurde mir angeboten direkt zu dem Preis zu kaufen oder in Wardrobe zu dem Preise zur Anprobe. Denke mir nichts und lege ihn in Wardrobe, kÃ¶nnt ja sein, dass er nicht passt, also nutze ich doch den komfortablen â\\x80\\x9eZur-Probe Bestellwegâ\\x80\\x9c. Schwups bestellt und bekomme per Mail die BestÃ¤tigung, aber ohne Preis (0,00 EUR wurde abgebucht) steht da nur in der BestÃ¤tigung, denke mir nichts, denn habe ja fÃ¼r 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt, also wird es schon passen. DrÃ¼cke nochmal auf den Artikel und sehe Preis liegt jetzt bei 87 EUR, ok denke ich, da habe ich ja nochmals GlÃ¼ck gehabt und einen richtig guten Preis bekommen. Denkste! Heute Schuh bekommen, passt perfekt, also gleich ins Amazon-Konto und Schuh behalten drÃ¼cken, aber was steht da. Schuh fÃ¼r 87 EUR kaufen oder zurÃ¼ckschicken. Hmm, aber ich habe doch fÃ¼r 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt und bestellt. Aber nirgends ist ein Beweis dafÃ¼r zu finden. Im Kundenkonto steht 87 EUR und in der BestÃ¤tigungsmail kein Preis. Habe das doch nicht getrÃ¤umt, also Kundenservice angerufen, aber nichts zu machen. Ich kann gerne zurÃ¼ckschicken, die 87 EUR ist der Preis. Ok, das war kein besonders gutes Kauferlebnis, muss ich jetzt die Preise abfotografieren nach der Bestellung. Na egal habe den Schuh trotzdem bezahlt, er war auch mit 87 EUR sehr gÃ¼nstig, aber Ã¤hnlich Zalando (89 EUR) was aber gar nicht entscheidend ist wegen ein paar EUR mehr oder weniger. Aber sehr unbefriedigend ist schon, das man Artikel zu einem bestimmten Preis in den Warenkorb legt und dann offensichtlich ohne es zu merken oder den Preis bestÃ¤tigt zu bekommen zu einem anderen Preis bestellt bzw. dann den Kauf abschlieÃ\\x9fen muss. Das geht so nicht! Habe definitiv beim Abschicken der Bestellung (Knopf jetzt Bestellen) den Preis von 79 EUR angezeigt bekommen und erwarte dann auch, dass ich zu dem Preis kaufe und kein anderer, auch wenn Preise â\\x80\\x9eim Hintergrundâ\\x80\\x9c schwanken. Aus meiner Sicht ein Fehler im System und fÃ¼r mich ein Grund Wardrobe nicht zu nutzen. Also Vorsicht beim Bestellen Ã¼ber Wardrobe! Keine Ahnung ob ich ein Einzelfall bin oder andere auch schon diese Erfahrung gemacht haben, definitiv muss Amazon aber hier am System nachbessern. No es la primera vez que compro zapatos de esta marca, pero estos llegaron en una caja distinta, no de la marca, una caja de amazon y sucio uno de los tenis, como que  usaron 1 o 2 veces, se notaba que pisaron con el. Es sind schÃ¶ne Schuhe, die auch sehr wertig Aussehen und sich nach dem Eintragen gut anfÃ¼hlen.Leider ist vor kurzem eine Naht geplatzt und damit auch gleich der Schuh offen.Keine zusÃ¤tzliche Verleimung etc. sondern die EINFACH GENÃ\\x84HTE \"ZIERNAHT\" ist, an dieser Stelle, alles was den Schuh zusammenhÃ¤lt.Sie sehen Wertig aus, ohne wirklich Substanz dahinter zu haben. Ich werde mich wohl nach einem Schuh, made in EU umschauen. Bonitos cÃ³modo y amplio, pedir talla habitual de zapatos Bin immer sehr skeptisch bei Schuhen online bestellen. Aber dieser: reingeschlÃ¼pft und fast wie angefertigt.Auch das Laufen ist sehr sehr gut. Absolut zu empfehlen!!! Zufrieden Die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe schwitzen darin. Luft undurchlÃ¤ssig. Keine Empfehlung Beautiful â\\x80\\x9cI wear size is 9 base on the chart size I take 8.5 but the material the rubber soles are too hard in general the whole material Zum Top - Preis - super Schuhe. nan Guter Tragecomfort auch bei lÃ¤ngerem Spaziergang, gute QualitÃ¤t, kann Ich nur weiter empfehlen! I like the design. The size is bigger than expected. The price is fluctuated by color and sizes and time that the order is made. Top QualitÃ¤t super Schuh passt super zum Anzug ! Small wide, they are very thin Dieser Schuh fallt eher kleiner ausIst fÃ¼r Schlange FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe eher geeignet...Die Sohle ist eher etwas hÃ¤rter das sich im Tragekomfort negativ auslegt These shoes was perfect for my Ck outfit..went very well. They were cute and different. Everyone love them..asked where I get them ftom Die Schuhe wurden super schnell geliefert und sitzen super. QualitÃ¤t richtig gut. I love them In liked the appearance and material of the shoes. Disappointed that the shoe didnâ\\x80\\x99t fit Danke schÃ¶n +++ First off, I didn\\'t need these shoes. But as they offered a stylish upgrade at an excellent price, I couldn\\'t say no.As I do with any pair of Clark\\'s, I ordered a half size smaller than my normal size and these fit perfectly. Plus, they\\'re well-made, comfortable, and versatile enough that I can wear them with jeans or a suit. And did I mention the price was a steal?If you need to up your shoe game for a budget-friendly price, this is the pair of shoes to do it! I ordered this in tan to replace a shoe I ordered in a size 11.  The size 11 shoe was tan.  This shoe from this seller in a 10 1/2 is BROWN.  there is a distinct color difference.  Did not bother to send back.  These shoes run about half a size too big.  Waste of money for me this time. Size way down. Stunning shoes but I normally wear a 10 and the 9 1/2 fit like an 11. I might try a 9 if they come back on sale again. I would have left 5 stars if the fit was better. I purchased these for my husband because his dress shoes were old and ugly and dated. They are classy, they are comfortable and he looks way more modern. The shipping was very bad! The shoes box was ruined completely. This style will never get old It is very nice and well made. If you are thinking about buying it then do it! you will have no regrets. The shoe looks feels and  fits great!!! Nice solid yet flexible shoe. Great support. Did not fit. Written this before but it always bears repeating: I. HATE. These kinds of reviews.They\\'re loafer style sneakers. They\\'re black loafer style sneakers. They\\'re a nothing fancy wardrobe mainstay that you really don\\'t think about much. They wear out and you get new ones so, what in the heck can you say other than that? Lol.Design-wise, they were smart and put in a scant little inch in the heel. An inch isn\\'t noticeable in the slightest- you don\\'t even conciously feel it but, when you have a tendon problem in your foot or heel... OMFG does that little inch make all the difference!!!The designer was also thoughtful enough to make the interior sole ever so slightly fuzzy. Anyone who has *ever* gone without socks in warm weather (pretty common to do in this style of shoe) know why that\\'s a nice detail that is sadly lacking in a surprising number of shoes.I know that doesn\\'t bother a lot of women because they have forced themselves to get used to it but those hard interiors that make the inside all icky gross the *instant* your body even *thinks* about sweating drive me bonkers. Lol.Maybe it\\'s the 110F summers where I live but whatever the reason, I am always grateful for an all cloth interior for an enclosed shoe. Lol.Anyway, there wasn\\'t any breaking in for me on these. Another nice touch. I was able to wear them straight out of the box as if I had them for years.On the other side of things, they also seem to be wearing quite well.So, yeah, they don\\'t look like anything special and, I guess in a way, they\\'re kind of not but, they\\'re nicely put together enough that you *don\\'t* really think about them. Well, at least, you don\\'t unless you\\'re sitting in front of a blank Amazon Review screen which, for me at least, proves that they\\'re actually a nice product that probably won\\'t get nearly the reviews that they probably should. ;) Everyone is being nice and saying \"These run small, haha!\" but I just ordered a size 8 and it doesn\\'t even fit my sister who usually wears a 6. Same story with the other pair of shoes I bought from this brand. This isn\\'t just running small, this is inaccurate sizing. Shoes aren\\'t like clothes, I know i have to be careful when i order pants or shirts because sizes can vary. But in every other store on the planet earth I wear a size 8 (US). This is just inexcusable honestly. Instead of expecting shoppers to order one size up, how about you just measure the actual shoes and send them the right size? These shoes are awesome! I have wide feet and have been wearing Sketchers that never fit quit right, so decided to try these. Best fit Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever had. They are made MUCH better. I ordered 8W.  Other shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve even tried 8WW, but these are perfect.  Wish I could find white ones. Love them! Even wide the toe band is way narrow.Other than that they\\'re comfy.Very well made. Love these due to that they are so comfortable, and easy to slip into. I got them in black & then ordered them in blue. I ordered my regular size. Finally bought inexpensive narrow shoes.  Didnâ\\x80\\x99t really care for color but wanted comfortable fit.  These shoes are definitely perfect in that requirement! Lifestride shoes caught my eye on sale in a physical shoe store but selection was very limited so I hoped to find them similarly priced online. My usual size (9.5) felt a rather snug, not necessarily uncomfortable short term but I could not guess we\\'ll enough what it would cause during longer wear. They seem to advertise having some kind of special arch support.. I\\'m not blown away by that, having said that I don\\'t feel my feet fatigue either soo.. I guess thats working?On here I chose to go to a size 10 \"narrow\" just in case 9.5 really was too snug. I\\'m happy I did. The nose seems a little long but is just perfect while walking around. I have weirdly narrow long feet that also tend to get ugly gaps with low cut shoes. I still have some gaping but it isn\\'t triggering me as much as it normally would. The shoe cups and forms nicely around my feet (no slipping off my heel yay!) and the leather is very soft. They\\'re absolutely worth a try. Shoes were better than I expected. Shoe fit true to size and had a great cushion at the bottom for support! Love and would buy again. Produit arrivÃ© une dizaine de jours avant la date prÃ©vue, en super bon Ã©tat et soigneusement emballÃ© (chaque support emballÃ© individuellement dans son papier). Vraiment satisfaite de mon achat. Parfait Son muy funcionales buen producto. solo que no incluye los taquetes. pero si los tornillos. Muy bueno Todo en orden grxs Love these! I ordered a 5 pack to keep my kids balls off the ground and looking a little more pottery Barn. In fact I got the idea from pittry barn! We live them, are using them all. They even hold the kids football helmets. Super cute, very strong and live that the cone with drywall screws too!! Used these to make a memorial board for my uncle who was also a coach. The rings are very sturdy and look great. The balls also sit in them well without falling. However, screws that come with them are cheap. The drill striped the screws before they were driven even half way in resulting in a late night Wal-Mart run. Not a deal breaker but might be helpful info. We bought these to hold our sons\\' basketballs so that they weren\\'t always rolling around on the floor in our garage. These are definitely suitable for displaying a \"trophy\" ball in a bedroom on the wall but we just wanted an inexpensive solution for our garage and these fit the bill. We mounted these on a stud in the garage so they are very sturdy but still not meant for a lot of weight; even more so if you were to mount them on an inside sheet rock wall, even with wall anchors, these are only meant for supporting the weight of ball, not much more. These are exactly what I was looking for - a minimalist way of storing mini basketballs. The are super simple to install and look great. Perfect size for what I needed. For the price I do recommend them. I did not use the anchors that came with them and instead used my own that were better for my walls. Only 1 star deducted because one of them broke (see pic) after 8 months of use. It\\'s not a big deal because I\\'m only using 3 and the package came with 5, so I just unscrewed the base of the broken one and installed one of the leftovers. Bella sneakers e soprattutto ottimo prezzo! I miei figli calzano da sempre primigi per cui sulla misura sono andata sul sicuro. I dig these shoes.  The color is great and slightly unique so you don\\'t look like everyone else. Plus they are very comfortable which is a bonus. Nice look and very comfortable.  I wear them all day in the office and have zero issues. It runs have size bigger High quality, lovely looking and very comfortable.Will order more from Bugatti shoes, I like the fact that size of all their shoes is constant. Ich wusste, was ich kaufe und es war drin, was ich haben wollte. Super Schuhe I want to love these. They are very cushioned, like you are on foam springs and they look amazing, but that\\'s it. I feel like I can slip out of them or roll an ankle. The shoe material is so stretchy, it feels like a child\\'s craft foam fabric which is great if you want light weight but seller is wrong to classify this as a cross-trainer. It is for running IF that, maybe just a pretty house slipper. Also I have narrow feet but this is for people with like 2D feet. Squishes down  from top to sole not width. I usually fit size 9, these were 9.5.Was going to return them but I do love how they look and they are comfy, just not for any athletic. I admit I bought these shoes because they look so cool and I\\'ve always loved Reebok\\'s comfort.  And when I first put them on, I loved them.  But after walking around the house for an hour or so, they felt so tight!  The fabric really didn\\'t stretch even as much as leather might.  I bought an 8 1/2, which is 1/2 size larger than I normally buy, so I didn\\'t feel comfortable moving to a 9.  It wasn\\'t the length that was the problem; they were just too inflexible.  Sadly, I sent them back. These shoes look great and I enjoy the lack shoe laces but.....when I get to doing a fast pace walk or an incline walk I feel like I\\'m walking at am angle. Like I\\'m about to roll my ankle. I think I\\'m going to stick to my other athletic shoes for workouts. These are still cute for around town though. First of all, I love the design!Secondly, the comfortness is great. Soles are bouncy and the sneakers overall is very light.My size 7.5 US women and 39 as Europe women sizeI have been using for about two weeks, therefore I can not tell if they are long-lasting or not. But hopefully, they will last for about 2-3 years. Because I love the design and texture of the sneakers so much.The color white get dirty easily, so not recommend to run on rainy day.And $50 for this cool pair of sneakers... I must say it is a pretty nice price. Running shoes have become quite expensive recently and price range are usually from $60 or above. They are very comfortable and fit as expected. For use around the house they are ok. These are not for cross training. The material is like neoprene and when working out or walking outside on slanted ground your foot slides all over. These are so comfortable and flexible.  I wear between an11 and 12, I ordered the 11 and after I broke them in they are wonderful.  No blisters,  no problems.  And I absolutely love the style,  they look amazing. I like the way they look and they are comfortable.. however with the way the sole is it makes it very easy to roll ankles if you have weak ankles and they are not breathable. The shoes\\' stretchy material makes them tough to walk down hills with as I feel like my foot is going to fall out through the toe area. Otherwise they are comfy and it feels like I\\'m walking on clouds. I think they run small or I didn\\'t size myself correctly but it\\'s a hard to tell because the material of the toe of the shoe is so stretchy that what seemed OK at home and was comfortable actually wasn\\'t when I went out on the trail. It\\'s great not to have to tie untie these shoes and they keep their shape. These shoes are really good for runners. The support for my arch has been amazing! I will be purchasing another pair Been wearing ours for less than a month, and during Virtual learning, and they are a mess! We donâ\\x80\\x99t really go places very often and they are wrecked. I know my 7yo plays hard but I expect the shoes to last more than two months! The front piece is almost dangling off and under that it looks like the mesh will rip. I like the fit of the Adidas but I think we are going back to Nike for durability. For the price, you can\\'t beat them! Our son loves them, and he is picky about shoes. excelent soft good thanks Would order again great quality Picture shows good but in reality it looks ok and does not looks appealing. I would skip this Greta shoes and my son loves them. Unfortunately they run narrow. Look great. Good value. They run slightly small. Fits perfectly. My kid loved the shoes easy to put on and light and fast Ich liebe diese Farben von dem Sneaker - auÃ\\x9ferdem passt er wie angegossen und es lÃ¤uft sich herrlich darin! Love it!

ATENCIÃ\\x93N: En mi experiencia soy Fan de la marca puma, siempre compro mi nÃºmero 9 y me quedan perfecto, pero en este modelo en especifico una vez compre en nueve y por el corte me quedaron super justos, yo recomiendo comprar un medio nÃºmero mÃ¡s a lo que estÃ¡n acostumbrados. De ahÃ\\xad a mÃ¡s, los tenis estÃ¡n hermosos, los materiales, los acabados, en fin, los recomiendo, como siempre llegaron antes de tiempo, recomiendo las compras por Amazon, excelente atenciÃ³n y servicio. Gracias MÃ©xico! La horma es algo justa. Tengo el pie delgada y me quedo exacto el nÃºmero que pedÃ\\xad. Ya habÃ\\xada leÃ\\xaddo comentarios dÃ³nde mencionan que la horma viene justa y si es cierto, por eso contemplÃ© un nÃºmero mÃ¡s grande de lo habitual para mÃ\\xad. No me quedaron olgados pero tampoco apretados Soy 8 y pedÃ\\xad 8 1/2 , de lo largo quedo bien, el tema es que esta muy estrecho y justo en el empalme. Los tengo que usar sin calcetines, y aun asÃ\\xad me aprietan. Entiendo que es un modelo bajo lo o que lo vuelve reducido en tamaÃ±o es por eso qur los pedÃ\\xad en 30,00 ya que mi talla es 29,5 pero la diferencia en tamaÃ±o es mÃ\\xadnima.

Talla correcta. Todo exelente Muy buena calidad La comodidad Super comfy. I love puma shoes. Great style too. Check them out!!! This shoe is so cute with skinny leg jeans. I was not too thrilled with the inner sole because there really isnâ\\x80\\x99t one. Inside feels unfinished to the bare foot. I plan to purchase some inner soles to give this shoe a more completed feel. Son perfectos. VolverÃ\\xada a comprar. EstÃ¡n hermosos,  delicados... Da wir in keinem GeschÃ¤ft unserer Stadt noch irgendwelche Gummistiefel fÃ¼r unsere Tochter gefunden haben, weil ihre GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe schlicht und einfach stÃ¤ndig ausverkauft war, haben wir uns entschlossen, nun hier welche zu bestellen und sind wirklich vollkommen zufrieden.Die Gummistiefel sind gut verarbeitet und vor allem wasserdicht, sie passen perfekt und trotzdem bieten sie noch genug Platz fÃ¼r dicke Socken an kÃ¤lteren Tagen. Zudem sehen sie wirklich schick aus und sind auch von der Verarbeitung her wirklich in Ordnung.Ebenso fand ich den Preis fÃ¼r die Stiefel angemessen und vollkommen in Ordnung, so dass ich insgesamt nur die volle Punktzahl von 5 geben kann. Unsere Tochter liebt diese Gummistiefel, alleine wegen der Farbe und des Einhorn. Die Stiefel machen einen guten und soliden Eindruck und sie hat nicht so schlimme Schwitze-FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe darin. FÃ¼r den Preis definitiv eine Kaufempfehlung. Comprati per mia figlia di 5 anni, per le escursioni nei fiumi e per quando piove. provati ottimo rapporto qualitÃ\\xa0 prezzo. L\\'interno dello stivale rimane caldo e asciutto soprattutto. Buona anche la suola con tacchetti che evitano cadute per scivolamento.Buon acquisto!!! Abbiamo scelto questo prodotto perchÃ© alla nostra bimba piacciono molto i cavalli e gli unicorni e indubbiamente ne Ã¨ rimasta molto colpita e ha subito apprezzato gli stivali nuovi.....peccato che dopo il primo utilizzo \"di prova\" , nel giardino di casa in assenza di pozzanghere, l\\'immagine risulti giÃ\\xa0 rovinata. Peccato davvero..VestibilitÃ¡ adatta. Stivaletti dai colori vivaci e comodi, la bambina li usa volentieri e ci cammina bene.Simpatica la fantasia utilizzata e l\\'unicorno e\\' un piccolo bonus che piace ai bambini.I materiali non mi entusiasmano, speriamo che durino nel tempo. Buy the real size your child currently wears, not bigger! According to the measurment scheme attached to the page you should order at least one size bigger. Wrong. This is what I did and it was a mistake. We kept the boots for the next season anyway (we like the boots overall)  and ordered one size smaller, t.i. the right size my girls wear now. Ich wollte diesesmal nicht auf den discounter zurÃ¼ckgreifen und testete diese Gummistiefel, leider bin ich sehr enttÃ¤uscht. Meine Tochter hat hinterher richtig nasse Socken, da sie hier drin sehr stark schwitzt. Das hatten wir bisher in keinen Schuhen bzw. Stiefeln. Boots have an awful odorat! I take out from a plastic bag and they stayed all day out for aeration and nothing helped. That awful odorat of chemical plastic is everywhere at the house.. unfortunately they will go back..The boots are for a large foot Die Optik des Stiefels hat uns gefallen.Aber:Das Material ist nicht flexibel genug, es biegt sich nicht beim Gehen. AuÃ\\x9ferdem ist der Stiefel schwer fÃ¼r unsere 2-jÃ¤hrige Tochter. Ich habe mir die tollen Gummistiefel fÃ¼r meine Tochter bestellt. Sie trÃ¤gt gerade GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 23 und ich hatte ihr eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer in 24 bestellt. Da hier einige meinten die Stiefel fallen kleiner aus, was ich aber garnicht zustimmen kann. Die Stiefel kann sie dann im FrÃ¼hjahr anziehen bis dahin werden sie passen. Behalten haben wir sie weil sie wirklich super schÃ¶n sind und auch von der QualitÃ¤t her einwandfrei. Per ben due volte ho dovuto restituire l\\'articolo. Ordinato il n. 42, ma Ã¨ arrivato il 41. Per la prima restituzione col cambio articolo ho parlato anche con un\\'operatrice amazon per essere sicuro mi venisse sostituito con la taglia giusta, ma nulla da fare,  la sostituzione Ã¨ stata fatta sempre con taglia errata. Muy buena pinta, suela blandita, pero demasiado pequeÃ±o. Talo 41, comprÃ© 41 y es pequeÃ±o, lo devuelvo. Desastre total. No tienen ni dos meses y apenas los he usado y ya estÃ¡n despegados o rotos por el talÃ³n. Belle e comode mio figlio ne Ã¨ soddisfatto Ottime Sneakers calzano bene e la suola interna Ã¨ molto comodo Preciosos Ordinato 42.5. Ricevuto 41.Pero lo stile, colore e qualitÃ\\xa0 sono top. Per questo due e non solo una stella. bellissime scarpe davvero comoda e molto minimal stile element nice Excelente producto Las zapatillas son muy bonitas, pero es la segunda vez que intento comprarlas y se equivocan con la talla. This shoe is sturdy, well made and very attractive (looks better in person than the photos). It fit me well as far as length and width, but unfortunately I had to return it because the left shoe was rubbing on my ankle bone. I guess my heel was fitting too low allowing the shoe to be high enough to ride on the bone instead of under it. An insert might have fixed the issue, but I don\\'t like altering new shoes. I\\'m sure this issue is my anatomy and not the shoe design. Clarks are the best!  Love this shoe - it has support, is comfortable and the fit is exactly right! I got a size 11 and had to send them back. Couldn\\'t even get my foot in them. Overall they\\'re a cute shoe. But won\\'t work for me! Loved the styling. Sorry it was too short for my foot. Fit more like a 10. Too small not the right shoe. Really wanted to love these shoes. Initially very comfortable. After three weeks of daily wear on vacation, body of shoe has stretched at least a full size with only walking. Discovered after a light drizzle that soles have ZERO grip. No me han gustado a los dos meses de uso estÃ¡n rotas por la puntera y solo las uso para correr y hacer deporte mÃ¡ximo dos horas al dÃ\\xada pÃ©sima calidad ni volverÃ¡ a comprarlas. Very good! I like to much Manque un peu de largeur mais c est une des deux marque que je prÃ©fÃ¨re pour travailler I Love these ASICS. They are light & fit my feet perfectly.  Perfect for 12 hour shifts on the frontline. I really am impressed with this particular shoe. I got these to replace my Gel Excite 7s after the quiz on the Asics website told me these would be my best fit. I wanted something with more cushion than my last pair, but there\\'s nothing soft about these soles at all. Its like running barefoot on pavement.. And the heel is so narrow, when I run, my heel goes over the sole and pinches between the sole and the shoe wall giving me blisters on the bottom of my heels. Ive tried a few runs and they don\\'t get better. My knees and ankle hurt within the first mile due to lack of support. I can feel the shock in my heels with every strike. I wish I could return these. Please don\\'t waste your money on these. These shoes are cute, have a nice fit, and are very comfortable. I also appreciate that they donâ\\x80\\x99t make my size 10 feet look like I am wearing water skis. I have worn them for weight lifting and running and have had no issues with rubbing or sore feet. I tried 4 different shoes and ended up returning them all except this pair. They\\'ve eased some of my joint pain in my knees & feet after long runs. Definitely recommend! Love these shoes. Super bouncy and miraculously make my huge feet look small:) Absolutely love this shoe! Will be ordering another pair. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ran in mine and am now using them for everything. Super cute and light. Took wearing them for about a week to get them broken in and to the max comfort level. Tienen muy buena calidad y  se ajustan muy bien These look and feel fake. Glue everywhere! Another thing the insoles look as if it comes from a ten dollar made in china sneaker from a bargain store. There is no name on it anywhere. I remember reebok\\'s having a name on the insole.Definitely feels and looks cheap! I bought these for home because I have Plantar Fasciitis and they even suck at home on hardwood floors. Outside they feel even worst. Oh and these things have 0 grip. Lol! The rubber slips as if it\\'s plastic. ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8fð\\x9f\\x91\\x8eWaste of money! I am a 7-7.5 in shoes, & in Reebok, have always worn 7.5. I saw the reviews warning that these ran small, but the Mineral Mist, in 7.5, was $22, so...had to try. At first I thought they were just too small, but a lot of that is their thickness & stiffness. I decided I was keeping them anyway (did I mention $22), & within an hour of wearing them, they felt fantastic, & I think an 8 would have been loose. They are gorgeous, & the colors are as vibrant as pictured. My only complaint was that the left shoe was just a teeny bit narrower across the top, as you can see in my photo, but it isn\\'t noticeable unless you\\'re looking for it. And I\\'m not giving up my $22 pair, so I\\'ll get over it. I can\\'t even deduct a star for it.Love the retro style, & great colors. I would definitely recommend, & wouldn\\'t hesitate to repurchase.(My pix are with & without flash to show the color difference, & the reflective strips.) Not just for hiking! I absolutely love these boots. I purchased them because I use to own quite a few pairs of Reebok shoes years ago and remembered how much I loved them and how comfortable they were and these are just as comfortable as I hoped they would be. I specifically was looking for Reebok when I found these. I wear an 8 and these in an 8 fit perfectly.  I loved that they came with black and purple shoelaces. This product looks very nice but it is not a comfortable shoe. It desperately needs a comfortable insole as inside the shoe is very hard and it took a couple of days to break it in. I thought it would be comfortable if I continued to wear them but that was not the case. Too late to return them so I am stuck. I do not recommend this shoe. Love the colors and the height of the shoe. The arch support is better than average. I went a half size up from my normal size and they were on the large side. After wearing them for an hour around the house the ball of my foot hurt terribly. Had to return them. Based on this experience I would steer clear of Reebock brand. I bought these because  needed a good pair of rugged shoes for mowing. These are perfect. I wish they had my 7 1/2  size, the they would fit perfectly. But they only had an 8, so I wear thicker socks so my feet don\\'t slide in them too much. Very comfortable, only took one time of wearing them that they became more relaxed. Well worth the money. Love everything about these except they are very wide where they lace up. You pull the laces all the way right and they still is too much room. The shoelaces come undone so face even loosen with a double knot. That being said, I love these shoes the color and width of the sole. Very comfortable if they werenâ\\x80\\x99t so big by top of the shoe. Love these, a lot of support and they look great. I am a true size 8 , ordered 8.5 because of all the reviews saying to size up 1/2 size and Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I did, they fit and I can wiggle my toes at the top, I do think true size would have been too tight perhaps. Love the color, comfort and ankle support. Caught these guys in sale and could not resist. The review mentioned the sizes run small and I was worried because I\\'m naturally a large size so I ordered an entire full size up and they fit perfectly! Duraron como un mes o dos y luego se separÃ³ la suela del tenis sin ningÃºn esfuerzo Shoes came promptly and look great. these are great.  quite stylish and comfortable.  People always ask where i got these from, of course I don\\'t tell them (smiling) Flash back to the 90â\\x80\\x99s!! I love the way they fit and feel on my feet!!! I remember these back when I was in high school. I love the look and they\\'re actually very comfortable. I wear them for style/nostalgia. Not for sports. Great for the 80â\\x80\\x99s themed party I went to recently. Love my BKs... they are true to size and comfortable!! Seller shipped immediately via fed ex. No issues!! Very narrow in the toe. No cushion inside. I love these shoes. They were the perfect throwback to the look I was going for and turned out to be really comfortable also. Iâ\\x80\\x99m always a getting people who stop and look and ask are those BKs and where did you find them. Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking that I need all the colors. So cute ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8d I love my new BK Great shoe, bad lace lock, stopped holding lace tight after a few weeks. Tried to get replacement lace or lock but unsuccessful. A bit disappointing for a pretty expensive toddler shoe. Great fit and look Habe die Schuhe wieder zurÃ¼ckgeschickt,waren leider zu klein EstÃ¡n muy chulas aunqie un poco grandes. Yo utilizo siempre en adidas 38 y 2/3 y son un poco grandes de lo habitual. La talla es un poco mÃ¡s grande de lo normal, sin embargo se ajustan perfectamente. Top Bequem und leicht zu tragen. Perfekt fÃ¼r Laufen.SchÃ¶ne Farbe passt zu allem. Perfecto para caminar pasear ir al campo senderos TrÃ¨s jolie basket et confortable je recommande Perfecto This shoe is as expected:  1) affordable as I don\\'t want to pay more than $40 for a good pair of shoes, 2) ugly as sin - just as depicted, and 3) comfortable.  Welcome to being 45yo. These were comfortable right out of the box and fit well. I purchased a10.5 and I have a narrow foot. I like the heel area because it really absorbs the shock. I purchased them to be able to walk on a wooded trail. I am able to comfortably walk over rocks, roots and dirt with complete support and shock absorbing cushioning. I have had these for 6 months and according to my pedometer I have put over a million steps on them and they are still as comfortable as when they were new.  I would recommend these for trail use or even as a good walking shoe for pavement because of the cushioning. I will purchase another pair when it\\'s time to replace these. Hab 2 Jahre hintereinander das gleiche Modell bestellt fÃ¼r meinen Sohn da er relativ breite und hohe FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe hat. Die Schuhe halten sehr gut warm und sind auch wasserdicht. Kann ich nur empfehlen. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0prodotto e arrivato usato,in d\\'iscrizione era scritto nuovo.non e possibile ,non posso restituire Top! Like these.  Fit is a little short & a little wide but that is what I usually have to put up with as I have narrow feet. See above Love them Great for my 95 year old mother with a hammer toe! Just has it was expected, my min said that is perfect. Great shoes Lo devolvÃ\\xad por demasiado grande y aÃºn no han reembolsado el dinero. Los zapatos son originales de hombre, ojo, son de orma grande, corren media talla o quizÃ¡ 1 entera mÃ¡s de lo normal, los pedÃ\\xad talla 7 y me quedaron bien, igualmente calzo 7.5 they look great. Great product verdaderamente confortables y suaves para caminar The Stitching Came Apart after 1 Time Wearing it These shoes were much too large. Amazing Loved the shoes! I\\'m not a dancer but I\\'m wearing them as flats. The seller was super diligent in connecting with me to make sure I understand how to measure. I just based it on the measurement when I put a tape measure to my foot.Since I\\'m wearing this as an \"everyday shoe\" I\\'ve put in some insoles which have made them a bit tighter but the leather will eventually adjust. Happy with my purchase! Pros: Made nicely, seem like comfortable, if it is your fit.Cons: Run large. My foot is 7 medium width, After reading the reviews I went from 7 (thats my Nikes, Sketchers-relaxed fit sneakers size), to 6.5 and they are still too big. Should have ordered at least 6. And still the fit is interesting. It is good that they have free return option with amazon prime, cause it is not so easy to find your fit. I am returning them and dont think I will order another size, cause they dont feel right for Zumba (slippery, no ankle support). But they might be good for other dancing lessons, like ballet for non-profs. If your foot is narrow, not high arch I would even recommend going from 7 to 6, cause in time they have a tendency to strech. (I can easily insert a finger, photo included). Bought these for my 16 year old son for a musical he is in.  He normally wears an 11 1/2 in tennis shoe and the size 12 fit perfectly. I needed to order jazz shoes for my daughter when she auditioned and earned a role for our local community theater. It was a first time for us, so I had no idea which of the shoes online to order. Ultimately I decided on these based on the good reviews and Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I did! They were perfect. Fit as expected and good quality.theyve stood up to the last three months of rehearsals and still look great. For reference my daughter is a size 5-6 depending on the shoe. The shoe looks like it is three times too small....until you put it on and realize that it stretches at the arch area to allow you to have a hell under your heel and a pad under the ball of your foot.  Despite the heel and pad, you will feel as it you are barefoot, but that is part of the design, so buy it if that is what you are looking for.  If you want/need something rigid that will offer support all around your foot, this is NOT the shoe for you.  It is, essentially, a leather sock, with something solid underneath to withstand the wear of dancing on.  If you plan on dancing a lot and want them to last, then have a cobbler add leather or suede sole to the bottom surface (floor contact) so that they last.  For the price, just order another pair when these wear out.  The fit is comfortable, however, you will want to insert some kind of liner in the front toe section of the shoe, at the very least, if not for odor management, then for comfort. The primary reason for this is the fact the very front of the shoe, where the pads of your toes rest, has NO insole, only rippled leather (extremely uncomfortable.  The insole of the shoe falls short about 2 cm or maybe 1\" of the very tip of the front of the shoe, so the pads of your toes will press on the stictching and ribbed material where the leather shoe is sewn to the sole pad.  Look at the pictures in the description.  Where you see leather ripples/ridges in the toe area....there is no liner, sole, or pad covering this area inside the shoe.  Your toes will not be happy.  An easy, cheap solution is to purchase, trim, and insert thin shoe liners that reach all the way up to the front of the shoe, and then you will be very happy with these shoes.  They are great for practicing or even dancing (socially), but be careful that others do not step on your feet because you will have no protection for the top of your toes.  Happy dancing!! The shoes seem fine, but going by sizing guide they are too large.  Especially considering you need to have them start out fitting very tight because they will stretch.  I don\\'t know any dancers who like their shoes to fit loose & sloppy.  You want them to fit like a second skin to your feet.  While your toes need to be able to spread, you don\\'t want your  feet sliding or slipping inside of the shoe.Will need to return and order a smaller size.  I ordered 7 1/2 and I wear a size 8 to 8 1/2 size street shoe, but it is hard to compare that to dance shoes.  Dance shoes need to fit different than street shoes.  Also, the lining inside one of the shoes was all bent up & would have been uncomfortable to wear.  I hope the next pair will not have the lining rolling up. Even in Chair Yoga we get out of the chair and do some standing poses.  I wear a size 8.5 shoe but I need orthodics  in them. So sometimes I have to go up a half size or even a full size.  I ordered these and they fit perfect with my orthotics in them!  They are super soft leather so it\\'s like I am barefoot with the support I need.  I can do all of the seated and standing poses, not perfectly, but that would take a miracle. My son dances a lot for musical theatre. I just looked up this order and am amazed at how long they lasted, well over a year, but  the sole is getting worn down now. They still look pretty good and support him but he is 15 and still growing so I think I probably ordered them on the large side but they are super comfy for him while dancing and if he forgets to take them to class he gets sore if he uses regular shoes.But I need to get the tan color instead of black so I re-measured his feet and will be ordering up by one size and definitely sticking with this brand.For the price I think these performed really well--all the seams are still perfect, nothing ripped or torn, just use shows wear on the soles and on the  leather part of the toe, partly from his feet growing.  For an adult or kid who dances more than him they will probably last for 6- 12 months. When new, they look just like the picture shows and don\\'t need to be broken in. I followed directions and purchased the shoe a size or two up . I wear a 10 1/2 or 11 when it\\'s cut  small  i know to get a 12 or 13 because i have wide feet . But great quality . I have used the shoe many times.  I will buy it again. After reading many reviews, I decided to just do what the manufacturer suggested. I measured my daughter\\'s foot, which heel to toe was exactly 9 3/4 inches. Based on the manufacturer\\'s own guide, I ordered an 8.5 for her. In my gut I knew this had to be wrong, as she usually wears 7.5 or 8 max. But based on their own guidelines, I went for it. THEY. WERE. HUGE. HUGE. and HIDEOUS. I wear a 9 and they were HUGE on ME. She needed them asap, so I hop on and order a size 7.5, thinking an entire size down would be better. Wrong again. The 7.5 were better, but still and entire size too big for her. .At this point I gave up, took her to our local dance store and ponied up the $15 extra they cost there vs. these. They fit great and are much more attractive. I would not recommend these. Not worth my time, and now I have to send these monsters back lol. Passt perfekt!In Frankreich ist es unmÃ¶glich, FuÃ\\x9fballschuhe dieser GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe zu finden!Schade, dass ich sie momentan nicht auf dem Feld ausprobieren kann! Super Prodokut, wie beschrieben. Purtroppo Ã¨ arrivato un 44 anzichÃ© un 45 fatto reso Bester Schuhe. Schnee Lieferung mega Preis Passt gut und schnelle Lieferung Gute Beschreibung, schnelle Lieferung und passt perfekt ð\\x9f\\x98\\x84 They are super comfortable like all of the Cloudstepper line. I love that these are slip on, but like all slip on shoes they don\\'t provide a lot of side support. That being said, I have worn nothing else since buying them. Who really wants to tie up shoelaces? These are men of a certain age shoes and done well. Didn\\'t like the fit and look. Had to return. I have problem feet and order for house shoes.  The shoes arrived and tried them on perfect.  No break in period shoes were perfect.  Will order again.  Thanks for a great product. It looks good. Fitted as expect. Just as advertised,  fast delivery The cleats break, and this is the second that it has done it in. An sich, ein hervorragender Schuh (Material, Verarbeitung , Futter) Nur war er zu schwer, zu schmal (Schaft sowie vorne an den Zehen) und das Futter war so dick, dass er sich kaum hat schlieÃ\\x9fen lassen. Bei dem stolzen Preis, hÃ¤tte ich etwas mehr erwartet WunderschÃ¶ner kleiner Stiefel, leider war die Sohle zu unbeweglich. Mein Sohn konnte nicht mit laufen,daher ging der Schuh zurÃ¼ck! Sehr schÃ¶n, das auch die Einlegesohlen mit demselben Fell ausgelegt sind. Sehr empfehlenswert Der Schuh kam leider defekt an... Die Sohle lÃ¶st sich an der Seite vom Schuh. Great shoe for DH whoâ\\x80\\x99s recovering from knee replacement surgery.  Comfortable with a good solid footbed, easy on and off.  As suggested, I ordered a half size down from his usual and theyâ\\x80\\x99re a perfect fit.  Fast delivery tooâ\\x80¦.. thanks again Amazon Prime! Very comfortable and light weight. I ordered exact size extra wide. Perfect fit. These shoes are hard to find, thank you amazon! New Balance very well made and the right fit ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 Great shoes and service Everyday wear Comfortable and stylish for my son with autism.  He has wide feet and plantar fasciitis which causes heel pain in addition to having discomfort from flat feet. These are true to size, well crafted and highly recommended! I really love my old (now discontinued) 801 slip-on/clogs but needed a replacement.  Whatever your regular NB sneaker size is should be appropriate for these (I\\'m usually a 10.5 in NB and tried a 10.5 and 11 in these - the 10.5 was the best one).  That said, they do fit differently than the 801s - your heel lifts out of the back more, and the sneakers seem a little narrower (even though both are \"D\" width).  It\\'s just a different design, you get used to it enough.  The new ones are more up to date so are better from a looks perspective. These slips are really comfortable,  however I wish I would have bought them a half size smaller.  They fit perfect when I first bought them, but after having them for about a month, they have losened up. As people have said, you can\\'t run in them, well no kidding, they are slides, they will slide off your feet if you try to run in them. As far as the low back, ummm, slides, hello, they are supposed to have a low back, if you want something with a higher back, by Shoes, not SLIDES. I would have give 5stars, but the sizing issuse cot them a point. After several months of pretty consistent use.. Love them.. no issue whatsoever. They have worn as expected, I\\'m not working in them but I wear them for leisure consistently from the beach to the campground to around the house, etc.. Picture is wear at about 4 months.. Back of heel cup is soft and does not rebound after being stepped onto as the older NB slip-on did. It was solid. Iâ\\x80\\x99m hoping they bring back the old model which was built like my NB running shoe. Outstanding! Der Schuh ist kein Billigprodukt und auch nicht preiswert. Aber genau der sollte es fÃ¼r den Sohn sein. Da er Einlagen tragen muss, haben wir ihn eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt und die vorhandenen Einlagen gegen die orthopÃ¤dischen ausgetauscht. Da der Junior immer am Rennen ist muss der Schuh schon etwas mitmachen - und nicht nur gut aussehen. Junior trÃ¤gt ihn nun zwei Monate und wir (insbesondere er) sind Ã¼beraus zufrieden. Keine nassen oder kalten FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe (okay hier ist auch noch kein Winter). Also eine Empfehlung. Toller Schuh, gute Passform, leicht und gute QualitÃ¤t! Reduziert stimmt auch der Preis!Klare Kaufempfehlung! Calzan bien, son cÃ³modos, pero no son para entrenamiento. Son pesados, son para salir al dÃ\\xada a dÃ\\xada. El color es muy lindo, la talla ajusta perfecto, son muy ligeros y sÃºper cÃ³modos. Recomiendo su compra ampliamente. me encantaron , tuve problemas con la paqueteria pero si llegaron :) These shoes are beautiful and I do mean beautiful.  They are also well made and the leather is supreme.  However they  wear horribly. They wear very hot and the shoes are extremely heavy.  Within a week of wearing them I also developed plantar fasciitis. I love these shoes so far. I got the pale pink which is basically a neutral with my skin tone. Iâ\\x80\\x99m between an 8 and 8.5 usually, and size 8 fit perfectly. Lots of support in these shoes too and soo comfortable! My only worry is that the suede will show dirt quickly, so I treated these with a suede protector and so far they are good. The shoes are so comfy and I get a lot of compliments on these. However these have zero suede! The shoes are more of a final with a cushioned and comfortable lining. Even the box says suede, but there is no suede or leather on these ahoes Shoe is attractive, seems true to size, feels a bit heavy, but I like a heavy shoe.  I haven\\'t worn shoe yet, but looks like there is no arch support, if so I\\'ll use an insert. Good bargain for the price. Not sure if real Reebok as logo missingfrom shoe but word Reebok is Imprinted on sole of shoe and it comes in Reebok box. Cute and comfy. They are a mix of leather and nylon. Only thing is they are a little roomy for a 7.5. but I got them for a friend with wider feet so they will be good for her. I would buy a 7 for myself. Good. Fits well, I use this shoe when lifting weights at the gym or dancing because of its flatness. Nice colors, heard from others itâ\\x80\\x99s good quality. Will update if any issues appear. This Reebok is fire!!!!!!! Excellent! This is a work of art!! I love it! It fits great. I am a size 8 and i bought a size 8 and its just perfect. I am severly excited about this pair of sneakers and would recommend it to anyone. Viene reducido, PerdÃ\\xad talla 25.5 cm. y me mandaron 23.5 cm. Lastima porque si estÃ¡n bonitos :/ Very nice tennis shoes. My son loves them! The color is what sold them, and itâ\\x80\\x99s just ass vibrant in person. Looks good on the foot. These shoes are awesome so far. I have Morton\\'s neuroma in my foot so I\\'m always looking for a shoe with a wider toe box and cushion. I have played with these twice on hard court and I have had no toe jam and there is plenty of cushion. I tried the B width as well but those were a little too snug. The wide which felt really roomy but in the end worked great on court. There is no break in period. I am a 5.0 player and i\\'m rough on my shoes so we will see how well these hold up. I was so excited to received these because they looked so cool and flashy but immediately after I tried them on, they were super uncomfortable. The crease just above the top of the laces cut into my toes when I would bend my feet to take a step. I was surprised because the reviews claimed to be comfortable and did not need any breaking in. I must have got a bad pair. I returned them for a different brand entirely. I bought these to replace my last pair of court shoes for pickleball.  This time around I\\'m spending more because these are to be good for my planter fasciitis.  They feel comfortable just walking around the house!  Can\\'t wait to use them on the courts in the morning!  They may be worth the extra $$.(I can live with just about any color if they fit right :) ) I play tennis and this shoe is easy on my bunion and the knit material gives. I can play without any bunion pain. it is a wider shoe I ordered a 9B and it was perfect. I first tried a pair of 8.5 wide in the Guava/black through the prime wardrobe.  They were too big.  I normally wear 8 wide but my arches have started to drop,  getting flat footed so Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been trying a half size larger.  I sent them back and tried the black/lime in 8 wide.  I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get my foot into the shoe!  They were very tight.  I sent them back and ordered the guava/black in 8.5 wide again.  I loved the color.  Just a little out there for an old lady but I like them.  The second pair fits great!  There are differences in where the shoes are made and who made  them and what day it is.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a crap shoot.  I do recommend this shoe.  They are so comfortable on old feet.  I love the guava color.  Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten complements on them. This would be a great shoe, unless you have high arches. There is NO arch support and they are sooo flat. They are light, and breathable and great in every other way. But even with arch supports i had to send these back. Definitely more cushion in heel and leaves arches and front foot feeling beat up. The back material and the front material inside the shoe isn\\'t sewn together. It looks like to me it should be. A plastic like material is showing. BN won\\'t answer phone. Sent text and pics their website site said to do , no response. I guess I need to send back. Can\\'t find out if it is a defect. Poor workmanship even if it is suppose to be like this. I got the extra wide 10.5 and it still feels a little tight. The shoe strings are too short. I had another pair of NB shoes in pass that the string whee too short. I have to take the strings out of some of the whole to be able to have them loose enough to tie. That pair was from 5-10 years ago. Thought they would know by now to make their strings longer. I have a high arch, I don\\'t know if that is the reason I need more string length, but this is the only manufacturer that I have run into this problem. If I but a pair of the mens I don\\'t have that problem, just some of their women tennis shoes. I can\\'t keep waiting for them to respond to tell me if this is a defect to send them back.  Does anyone else that bought this show have the material inside the shoe look like this? where the front material and the back material in the inside isn\\'t sewn together? Please someone let me know, since I can\\'t get a response from NB. but the fit is perfect.  Will definitely order this again.  I was wearing Asics and the toe box on the Asics were so tight that I had horrible blisters.  Switched to New Balance and won\\'t go back.  The color is BRIGHT pink - but I am gettin used to it. I sometimes take a 6 medium width, sometimes a 6 wide, depending on the shoe.  I\\'ve had New Balance before and no issues.  However this court shoe in a size 6 was ridiculously narrow, I couldn\\'t even get my foot into the shoe with the laces wide open.  Sending back. Love the comfort of these shoes. Nice to actually feel comfortable in a pair of court shoes. Besser als erwartet. Top unf schnelle Lieferung. Ordered a size down from what I usually wear and they fit perfectly! The shoe does not look quite like the picture. It is over sized and I believe that Daffy Duck was the foot model. Unfortunately past the window to returnThese look like a KNOCKOFF I love them! I read the reviews in advance and made sure to buy a size and a half smaller than I would usually wear. They fit perfectly. They look fashionable and feel comfortable. Beautiful shoe but runs a bit large. I had to return unfortunately I love the style, the color the shape of this shoe, but I unfortunately didn\\'t read about the sizing on these until after I already ordered them, and by then it was too late!  But all the reviews are true - these shoes run really big.  I\\'m thinking a size 5 might do it for me (normally I wear a 6, but in Adidas 5.5 seems to fit better, over all).  I ordered these in a 5.5 and they are considerably large.  As I said, thinking a size 5 might do it, but not sure.  Anyone considering these shoes, please take heed - you will most likely need at least a half size below what you usually wear in Adidas. I like the shoes - Iâ\\x80\\x99m just lucky I saw ahead of time that they run so big.  The size 8 I just bought is the same, maybe a little bigger, than different pairs of size 9 adidas I have.  I understand different brands can fit differently (my doc martens are size 8), but I think itâ\\x80\\x99s weird to have so much variation in similar shoes of the same brand. This shoe runs big. I went out of the country and missed my return date. Now I\\'m stuck with an oversized brand new pair of shoes and most likely not going to get what I spent on it. The shoe itself arrived ok. It seemed like it can get damaged or bent super easily. Either way, not happy with the sizing difference. Not even a little big, it\\'s just too much. This is so fake itâ\\x80\\x99s ridiculous. Do not buy!! The tongue is a thin foam sheet with the adidas logo printed on it. Not stitched. Itâ\\x80\\x99s horrible and ugly and the sides have weird stitching. Just a horrible product. Iâ\\x80\\x99m surprised this came from amazon. Disappointed â\\x98¹ï¸\\x8f They were embarrassingly squeaky. They felt like they were made of cardboardâ\\x80\\x94especially the tongue of the shoe. I returned them. As others saidBefore it does run big. I am normally size 8.5/9, and this shoesStill a tiny big for me, but I am okay with it!But the shoes look just like in the picture  and are very comfortable. I really like it. Son preciosas, sÃºper cÃ³modas, me encantan, las recomiendo si o si Wirklich schÃ¶ne, bequeme Schuhe. Ich hatte etwas Sorge, da meine FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe relativ breit sind, aber die Schuhe passen hervorragend. Ich habe GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 39/40 und habe GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 40 bestellt, so habe ich wirklich viel Platz im Schuh ohne das er zu groÃ\\x9f ist und ich mit der Verse rauskriegen oder Ã¤hnliches.

Bought similar pair before but the size was US 6 last time, this time round both size is US 6B seem a little tighter for comfort. Seller should have mentioned. Bottom tread is gone in 2 months. Wonâ\\x80\\x99t buy Spenco again Estupendo, talla correcta (un nÃºmero menos de mi talla habitual). Questo modello calza piu grande rispetto alle scarpe estive modello NebulaLa manifattura sempre perfetta Soy muy buenas zapatillas y son transpirables no te operan los pies. Comode sembra di non  averle  preso  buon prezzo se quello era il vero  prezzo di vendita Articolo corrispondente alle mie esigenze. Ã\\x88 ciÃ² che cercavo tutto perfetto come in descrizione Mi piace non fa male Die Schuhe passen super, haben ein tolles Design und sind angenehm zu tragen. Man hat auch ein recht gutes GefÃ¼hl mit dem Ball. Ich habe mir die Schuhe bestellt, weil ich meinen alten immer FuÃ\\x9fschmerzen hatte... die Beschwerden sind nun weg. While I did like the fit and the upper padding, I had to return because the flat sole had me slipping around in the turf indoor while Iâ\\x80\\x99m in goal. I then got the same shoe with the turf soles and love them. Someone else I know who Only plays on field Prefers the flat soles so they donâ\\x80\\x99t get caught in the turf. So Iâ\\x80\\x99m happy they offer the shoe with both soles. They were not comfortable. They buckled up when I flexed by foot and was painful. These are wide so maybe that is why.It did have a nice solid sole that I think would have kept me front getting bruises on the bottom of my feet but the part where it buckled up on the top was too much. These are nice shoes, but I ordered them specifically because I am wide. I would recommend sizing up 1/2 size when ordering. I wish I would have ordered the 8.5. Muy buenos zapatos y la talla muy apropiada. Very comfy shoes but slide a lot on an interior gymnasium surface. Bien,  pero una cosa ,pedi a la vezi otras sandalias tambien 28 y cuando le estoy mediendo los dos, estos son mÃ¡s un 27. Era para un regalo y se ven de calidad. Impresionante lo bonitas que son!!! Taille petites , une taille de moins mais trÃ¨s jolies... Belli sandali Bonne qualitÃ© pointure ok agrÃ©able Ã\\xa0 porter Quedan justo a la talla que calzo normalmente. El diseÃ±o es muy lindo y son muy cÃ³modos. Me encantan!!! Vienen conforme a la talla, son muy cÃ³modos, diseÃ±o muy vanguardista, estÃ¡n igual que en la foto. Voy a seguir comprando de esta marca Me encantaron El producto llegÃ³ en una talla que no era la solicitada eran para bebe, en la descripciÃ³n del producto decÃ\\xada que eran de 22 cm y llegaron de 10 cm Supercute and very comfortable shoes. Fit as expected. Love the snake print and the shoelace color. I usually wear size 7, bought size 7 and they fit perfectly. Shipping was also fast. L\\'oggetto acquistato Ã¨ giunto prima del tempo di spedizione previsto e sopratutto Ã¨ in perfette condizioni. Descrizione dell\\'oggetto e delle taglie molto dettagliata. Straconsigliato!!! Fit great and look great. I love the unusual color and texture of snakeskin No ajusta bien I really like this shoe. Great fit, great look. Der Schuh passt genau wie erwartet. Vor allem die halben GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen sind von Vorteil und der Schuh ist sehr bequem. Super cute and fun. Got tons of compliments on them. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a size 7.5 and these shoes were true to size. They are a medium in width- meaning they are not too narrow for my foot that likes a little wiggle room. SchÃ¶ner Schuh passt wie erwartet und sieht gut aus auch die Farbe ist Ok bin zufrieden sind halt Converse Schuhe Fit perfectly, have gotten lots of compliments on them Extremely expensive, especially due to it being sent from US.

Although these are cute and very lightweight, as other posters have said they run small. In my case I ordered a size up, and they were still too small.  They also have a very narrow toebox, which affects the fit as well. The insole is definitely squishy, however there is next to zero arch support. This of course can be good for some people, as can the narrow toebox ( these would be great for one of my daughters, however they are not available in her size).  They do seem to be constructed well, and feel sturdy, although the sole is so light that it seems it would not hold up well over a few trail walks, but I have to return these so I won\\'t be able to find out for sure about that. My biggest problem with these shoes was that they rubbed the back of my Achilles tendon area. Maybe that only happens with some people, I really don\\'t know the reason. That was pretty much all it took for me to stop wearing them. They have a comfortable sole which is like memory foam or something. The shoe is a bit narrow so if your feet swell from activity they may be a bit too tight at the end of your day. I wore them hiking but they\\'re really more of a straight out walking and maybe running shoe. I bought them in gray which was also a bit boring and made my foot look longer. I love these shoes!!  However, they do seem run a little small; which is why I gave them 4 stars.  I usually wear a 7.5, which is what I ordered.  But I could tell when I first put them on that they were a little tight right up against my big toe. The first day was the worst one. They were already feeling tight but I jumped down to the ground from a platform to run to the car and as soon as I landed, my big toenails (and yes, they were cut) hit the toe of the shoe and I could feel that little bit of pain for the rest of the day.  It\\'s day three and I can tell they\\'ve stretched a little bit, but next time I\\'ll try an 8 to be on the safe side.  Otherwise, they are extremely comfortable.  They\\'re very soft and very light--I hate wearing heavy, clunky shoes.  They\\'re the perfect shape, also.  Not too small and thin like a simple pair of old school Keds, but not too bulky that you feel like they\\'d only work with jeans or athletic wear. I had on a nice grey t-shirt and some knee-length, jean shorts and they didn\\'t make my feel look like giant boats.  I would definitely order more in different colors. I usually where heavy walking shoes with lots of padding, plus custom orthopedic inserts, so I was concerned that I would not be able to wear these very long.  However the foot bed is very comfortable, and I find that I forget I am wearing them.  Although I checked the \"all day\" rather than \"couple of hours\" box, I probably would not wear them all day--but definitely more than just a couple of hours. My only complaint is that they only come in one width and for me are a little bit too narrow. I\\'ve begun walking at least 10,000 steps/day and was developing severe blisters on the balls of my feet, spreading to between my toes. I thought I had a good pair of shoes, but apparently not. As soon as I put these shoes on for my first walk on the treadmill after receiving them, it was as if the blisters were never there! These shoes are extremely lightweight and so comfortable!! I\\'ve been able to increase my walking and not have pain in my feet at all! I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone!!!!! You kind of feel the grid below the padding at the palm of the foot.Sizing is right. Looks like a good shoe. But I\\'m worried if the padding gets more compressed as one walks, you feel the underneath grid even more.  :| As soon as I put these babies on they felt like clouds. They offered me tremendous support on my feet. The color was a good color and the inside of the shoe is so soft, I wished all shoes were like these, soft and warm but pretty on the eyes These shoes are super lite, have this great memory foam insole and have held up very well. I used them for work in Healthcare. Lots of walking. But this would serve as a great running shoe as well. I love the color, the design and the fact that they are very light weight. Like some other reviews stated, they do seem to run small, especially in the toes. I had even ordered them a half size larger than I usually wear. I like these shoes.  I mainly walk for exercise and find them comfortable.  The size 7 fits well in width, but is a bit small for a walking shoe.  The size 8 is a bit wide.  Amy feet are narrow so it is not unusual to have width issues. Der Schuh hat eine schÃ¶ne, weiche Sohle, wenn man Probleme mit den Fersen hat, ist er einfach super. Sehr angenehm zu tragen. Los devolvÃ\\xad cuando llegaron vi que son brillosos, estaba esperando algo negro liso Son amplios, no los recomiendo para pie angosto, son bonitos. Too stiff to wear for an extended period of time and feel a bit clunky.  I wish I would have sent them back instead of trying to wear them.  Now I\\'m stuck with them. Purchased size 10 as other reviews said they ran large. Big mistake. Should have stuck with11 as they are somewhat narrow These shoes are a little stiff especially over tops of the feet, but I\\'m hoping they will get more comfortable over time with wear. Good item. It runs small and ripped up my heel as the back is hard Comfy and good quality. At first glance, I thought something was off with these black suede 1100s but I was not quite sure what was amiss. So I got out my favorite blue suede 1100s for comparison (see pictures).1. The contours of the shoe were different from my blue pair of the 1100s2.and upon closer inspection, the insoles were also quite different.You can see in the pictures my trusty blue suede 1100s come with a more expensive removable insole. The difference in quality is clear. but only because I have an authentic pair from a reputable brick and mortar store to compare the convincing knockoff 1100s to are the differences made apparent.Don\\'t get me wrong I don\\'t mind low cost \"replicas\", but I paid almost 140 with taxes for these. This could just be a one-off, or perhaps knockoffs are going undetected more than I imagined. Maybe the negative reviews for these shoes are actually for knockoffs and not the authentic NB product?In any event, I highly recommend you visit your local brick and mortar retailer. Call ahead and ask if they have the 1100s in your size and request they order them in all the colors you are interested in trying. That\\'s how I ended up with the blue ones.  Any local retailer still in business has to be doing something right and will be happy to order whatever you want. I wish I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t worn them or Iâ\\x80\\x99d send them back.  I ordered them as I kind of like the way they looked and I generally like NB. Narrower than a normal D. Uncomfortable on the TOP, as the laces dig in some. For me, OK to wear if Iâ\\x80\\x99m only going to be in them a little while and not walking much. Definitely not a walking shoe.So I\\'ve had these a couple of months now and thought I would share what I\\'ve found.The good - they are cool looking. i get comments every time I wear them and folks are surprised to see they are NB.They\\'ve gotten a bit more comfy as they have worn in some, but these are not shoes for being on your feet all day and they are definitely not a walking shoe. Good for casual wear.The bad - the sole (black rubber beneath the maroon sole) separated at the front on both shoes rather soon. I used some shoe glue (Amazon) and it did the trick, but one would think they could have joined them better at manufacturing.Would I buy them again? maybe. They do look good. Do not fit like other NB shoes.  They were very long.  They felt like clown shoes.  Sent hem back... they even tried to charge me shipping.  Complained and they relented. I never wore these shoes. My recent shoes from New Balance have all been size 13 4E (extra wide). I have several pairs of NB shoes in that size that fit me well. These shoes were much too big. I liked the way these shoes looked, but didn\\'t think it would be worth the trouble to try multiple sizes to see if I could find a pair that would fit. I now have two pairs of these shoes, and there is no doubt in my mind I will buy more!  I will probably own every color (6) by the time Iâ\\x80\\x99m done, thatâ\\x80\\x99s how great these shoes are!  They are very comfortable, as long as a proper insole is added (I have to do this with all my work shoes, as I walk 7 to 10 miles each day).  I also recommend, as others have, getting the wide size. Other than that, they are super stylish, comfy, and well made. I\\'m a 10.5 EEEE and I buy these in 11 and they fit great, look a little big but not crazy big.I wish new balance wouldn\\'t cancel this line (looks like they have) and I wish they would make a cool boot in the same platform /sole!!! I love the New balance 1100 shoes, I have them in blue, black, and brown (my favorite).  They\\'re very comfortable and appropriate for my office or going out.  They\\'re great with jeans or cords or khakis, wouldn\\'t wear them with dressier pants. I wanted to love these, since I\\'m a big New Balance fan, and I like the idea of a quasi casual shoe for work, but these weren\\'t as comfortable as I was hoping and I couldn\\'t justify keeping them at $130 a set... If they were under $100 and/or had more of a sneaker feel I would have kept them probably I\\'ve been looking for a classy yet very comfortable everyday shoe for awhile, so I was glad when I found these! They run true to size, and are narrow. If you have wide feet they might not work for you. I\\'ve been wearing these for the last few weeks and they\\'ve held up well. I plan to pick-up a few additional ones to have. Do feet a favor and buy these! Usually for my 11,8\" foot I order sneakers in size 12,5 D but due to previous reviews I purchased this shoes in 12 4E & now I\\'m happy with this extraordinary pair of NB Perfette e comodissime Scarpe comodissime e arrivate molto prima del previsto. Consiglio! Sneakers molto belli I bought these sneakers for my 83 year old mom. We\\'re both preppys from the old days; her the 50-60\\'s and me from the 80\\'s. Unfortunately, the shoes were just too narrow for her foot, and weren\\'t comfortable.  Thus, they were returned. I, on the other hand, do not have a pair of red sneaks, and Sperry fit my foot just fine. I will purchase for myself with a five start review! Cute but much narrower then my other pairs. A este artÃ\\xadculo le doy 10/10, me encantaron. Son los clÃ¡sicos sperry Brand new, a little tight first time wearing them, but after about 3 wears, fit just fine. These shoes are super cute and comfortable! I love them, would buy again! I really like these shoes!! Very classic look and extremely comfortable!! Great for my spring and summer look!! Didnâ\\x80\\x99t like fit or style. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s a good quality. Love the color and brand the sticking along the heel hurts The shoes are nice a bit snug though.  But just break them in and you are good to go.

Wie ich ihn dieses Jahr verbringen werde, ist eine Frage fÃ¼r sich.Doch, man braucht Schuhe, die man in der Zeit, in der sich Sonne nur zÃ¶gernd zeigt, schon mal der ganze Tag regnerisch ist, der Schnee ist auch nicht weit.Wenn die Tage im Nebel versinken, tut es gut, wenn die Schuhe (es sind hÃ¶rere Schue, keine Sneaker(s) im Ã¼blichen Sinne) in einer schÃ¶nen Farbe signalisieren - da bin ich, man sieht mich. ROT ist die Farbe der Schuhe, und sie ist einfach wunderschÃ¶n.Die Schuhe sind in \"H\" GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe/Weite, also weiter geschnitten, was mir/uns ermÃ¶glicht sie mit den Wollsocken zu tragen. Neben schwarzen SchnÃ¼rsenklen, die fast dramatisch wirken, gibt es auf jeder Seite einen ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss, der sich sehr leich Ã¶ffnen lÃ¤sst.Man kommt in die Schuhe sehr leicht hinein. Die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe danken es ihnen. Die Schuhe drÃ¼cken nirgendwo, sie sind leicht und doch stabil.Meine Ã¼bliche GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt hier.Es sind KEINE Goretex-Schuhe, man soll daran denken, wenn man im Regen/Schnee spazieren geht. Aber, sie vertragen schon etwas NÃ¤sse...KÃ¤lte, wie geschrieben, mit Socken.Sie sehen an den Beinen ansprechend aus. Perfekt kombinierbar, wirklich tragbar und wieder in SALE. Auch der regulÃ¤re Preis ist nichz zu hoch.So sehr ich Sneaker liebe, kann nur schwierig \"nein\" sagen, wenn ich wieder ein neues Modell sehe, so bin ich bei Herbst/Winterschuhen einer oder hÃ¶chstens zwei Marken treu geblieben. Diese ist eine von beiden.Was mir gefÃ¤llt, die Form ist modern, auch hier hat die Firma einige Schritte gemacht.Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung! Sehr schÃ¶ne \"ARA Damen Courtyard Sneaker\" im Farbton grau! Mir gefÃ¤llt insbesondere die dunkle Sohle mit schmalem Silberstreifen, ist nicht so schmutzempfindlich. Die Sneaker sehen schick aus, sind super bequem, warm gefÃ¼ttert mit innen liegender HighSoft Sohle. Ich schnÃ¼re die Sneaker so, dass ich nur eine Seite der je beiden ReiÃ\\x9fverschlÃ¼sse Ã¶ffnen brauche, um die Schuhe an- , bzw. auszuziehen. Wie immer passt die bestellte GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 38. Schon allein deshalb kaufe ich gerne ARA Schuhe! Ja die Schuhe sind schon etwas teurer, aber dafÃ¼r lohnt es sich. Die sind unglaublich bequem und geradezu gemÃ¼tlich. Hab sie mir gleich noch in einer anderen Farbe bestellt. Klare Kaufempfehlung. reinschlÃ¼pfen wohlfÃ¼hlen. FÃ¼r breite FÃ¼sse topp Weite G ist recht weit fÃ¼r einen \"normalen\" FuÃ\\x9f.Verarbeitung und Aussehen super! Certainement de bonnes chaussures ARA mais les chaussures livrÃ©es ne correspondent pas Ã\\xa0 la photo. Sur la photo de prÃ©sentation, les semelles sont marrons et j\\'ai Ã©tÃ© livrÃ© de chaussures avec des semelles blanches : cela ne donne pas du tout le mÃªme style. J\\'ai donc retournÃ© les chaussures et j\\'ai Ã©tÃ© remboursÃ© sans aucun problÃ¨me et trÃ¨s rapidement. Ich finde die Schuhe super, allerdings waren sie mir in meiner regulÃ¤ren SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 42 zu klein. Ein sehr gut verarbeiteter Sneaker! Super QualitÃ¤t super mit herausnehmbaren Sohlen!! Ist sehr bequem und optisch auch perfekt!!! Sehr zu empfehlen! Hatte den Sneaker zur Auswahl mit Mehreren bestellt. Es war eindeutig der Beste.Super schÃ¶nes TragegefÃ¼hl,  tolle Innensohle, bequem, warm...einfach ein toller Winter Sneaker! Das der Schuh eine bequeme weite hat scarpe in perfette condizioni, come da negozio Primigi. conforme alla descrizione su Amazon.consegna rapidissima, in anticipo di un giorno rispetto a quanto dichiarato al momento dell\\'acquisto.calzata ideale per la mia bambina, molto apprezzato il plantare interno in memory foam Sehr schÃ¶ner Schuh, aber selbst fÃ¼r die schmalen FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe unserer Tochter leider zu eng. Ottimo prodotto e consegna veloce Light and airy... Not supportive at all. If you are on your feet for long hours buy arch support insoles before trying to wear these... And wear socks that come higher than the cuff or you will be rubbed raw. I recommend getting a half size bigger than you usually wear. These were a gift for a friend who admired them while I was shopping. The first pair were too big but returned them and Alex is thrilled with them. They look really cool. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think they will be ever out of style. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s talking about buying another pair. The price is very reasonable for the great quality.  You should try a pair. I got these usually have no problem with puma shoes but these are a  little on a small side ordered a 9 but feels like a 8.5. I have blister under my ankle bone on both feet  the tops of my toes hurt from wearing these. J\\'ai commandÃ© un point et j\\'ai reÃ§u 1\\\\2 point plus grand.Une chance que ma soeur les voulait.Elle Ã©tait parfaitement adaptÃ©e Ã\\xa0 son pied. Love these shoes very nice and comfortable.  Looks  expensive  too.  I cant  say enough  about them.  I was glad they had 10.5 size  i can\\'t  keep it to myself.  I am ordering  a pair for my daughter.  Its too comfortable  to just keep to myself SÃºper cÃ³modos y muy bonitos!Soy talla 25, pedÃ\\xad 25.5 para no errar y me quedaron un poco grandes, pero muy bien Ultra confortable. Grandeur conforme au guide de taille. TrÃ¨s lÃ©ger comme matÃ©riel. J\\'ai l\\'impression d\\'avoir les pieds sur de la mousse mÃ©moire. J\\'adore ! The runners arrived as expected on time and in good condition.  They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. Had to return them as they didn\\'t fit and when I tried exchanging them they didn\\'t have the colour in the size I needed. Great look though ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8c I bought this for my mom and she loved it. So comfortable and nice. Ich habe zwei Jacken bestellt, in Farben Limette und GrÃ¼n. Die Farbe Limette ist wie abgebildet. Dies ist Geschmackssache. Was ich aber zu bemÃ¤ngeln habe, ist der Schnitt und vor allem die schlechte QualitÃ¤t des Stoffes. Ich habe die gleiche Jacke (in grÃ¼n), die ich schon vor ca. 4 Jahren in einem Store gekauft habe. Die ist mir Superbegleitung beim Regenwetter gewesen, nur ist sie etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Daher habe ich mir Ã¼berlegt, noch eine zu kaufen, war aber sehr enttÃ¤uscht. Die grÃ¼ne Farbe ist etwas abgewandelt, aber das ist nicht sehr dramatisch. Nur die alte Jacke war aus einem sehr angenehmen und weichen wasserabweisenden Stoff. Die Jacken, die ich hier bestellt habe, sind hart und daher stehen sie ab und schmiegen nicht an KÃ¶rper. Ausserdem wurde offensichtlich der  Schnitt geÃ¤ndert. Die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 36 sitzt jetzt anders, enger, unbequemer (auch des Stoffes wegen) und im Brustbereich extrem eng. AuÃ\\x9ferdem fehlen an der Jacke unter den Achseln zwei Ã\\x96ffnungen zur DurchlÃ¼ftung. Sehr schade. Die Jacken gehen sofort zurÃ¼ck. Die angegebenen MaÃ\\x9fe stimmen leider Ã¼berhaupt nicht. Habe statt 48/50 schon 56!!! bestellt. Und mehr geht leider nicht.Lt. eigener BMS-GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fentabelle im Umfang 140 cm.Nachgemessen leider nur knapp130 cm. 10cm !!! weniger.Klingt gut, wenn man sagt, wie liefern bis 56.Aber genaugenommen ist es nur eine ganz knappe 48/50.Schade, das man da nicht genauer arbeitet oder zumindest die Angaben richtig macht.Und...OekoTexSiegel und dann kein Baumwollinnenfutter(wie fast alle Mitbewerber), sondern Nylon?Schade,war zwar die teuerste aber trotzdem mein Favorit,bei meiner Jackenauswahl.Anmerkung: 2 Flyer plus 2 A4 Hochglanz/4-Farbdruck ProduktblÃ¤tter plus 1 A4 Hochglanz-OekoCertifikate plus 1 A4 Umweltinfo-Blatt  plus ein 42-seitiger Katalog(in welchem die kompletten Infos der losen BlÃ¤tter bereits sowieso enthalten sind) relativieren fÃ¼r mich ein eigentlich lobenswertes Engagement fÃ¼r Umweltschutz.VÃ¶llig Ã\\x9cberflÃ¼ssig !!! ZunÃ¤chst das Positive. Das Material fasst sich sehr gut an, riecht nicht und hat keinerlei Knitterfalten nach dem Transport. Die Farbe ist ein sattes Melonenrot, wirklich schÃ¶n. Habe 2 Nummern grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt und die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt perfekt. Sie ist hinten lÃ¤nger und sieht wirklich gut aus. Sie hat tiefe Taschen, in die allerhand reinpasst. Als  Regenjacke kann ich sie aber Ã¼berhaupt nicht empfehlen. Ich war 10 Min. bei leichtem Regen unterwegs und komplett nass an den Unterarmen und vor allem an den Schultern. Jeder Windzug geht durch. Der Futterstoff innen ist glatt und kÃ¼hl. Das ist unangenehm vor allem in den Taschen. Nach dem Tragen braucht die Jacke ewig zum Trocknen. Ich habe Regenjacken fÃ¼r 1/3 des Preises, die funktionieren. Dies war ein Fehlkauf und ist einfach nur eine Ã¼bermÃ¤Ã\\x9fig teure rote Jacke. Schade. Die Jacke ist echt hÃ¼bsch.  Weil Leute schrieben, man soll sie grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellen, hab ich schon befÃ¼rchtet, dass meine normale GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe zu klein sein wÃ¼rde und habe gleich 2 Jacken in Gr 52 und 54 bestellt.  Normalerweise trage ich eine 46/48. Ich hatte den Plan, einen dicken Wollpulli drunter zu ziehen.  Aber die 52 - also 2 Nummern grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer  - ist einfach zu eng. Die 54 passt, aber mit Pulli wÃ¤re es zu eng. Habe beide zurÃ¼ck geschickt und jetzt eine 56 bestellt.An sich eine wunderschÃ¶ne Jacke, die gut verarbeitet ist.  Das Material ist etwas steif. Die Farbe und Verarbeitung sind top. Aber die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fenangabe stimmt einfach nicht.Eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bedeutet dann aber auch, dass die Ã\\x84rmel entsprechend lÃ¤nger sind.  Was sich auf dem Rad dann allerdings auszahlt.  Aber die Schultern sind halt auch breiter.  Aber mir gefÃ¤llt die Jacke trotz dieser (grÃ¶ssentechnischen) MÃ¤ngel sehr und ich freue mich auf die Lieferung der grÃ¶Ã\\x9feren Jacke. Das Ding ist schon ein Hingucker mit den PÃ¼nktchen. Kaufe nur noch BMS Gummistiefel, weil mich die QualitÃ¤t einfach Ã¼berzeugt. Die sind zwar nicht gerade gÃ¼nstig, aber jeden Cent wert, wie ich finde. Sie sind elastisch (bleiben auch an kÃ¼hleren Tagen \"weich\", haben einen relativ kurzen und weiten Schaft, so dass Hosen locker reinpassen und auch krÃ¤ftigere Beine gut Platz haben und sich die Kinder super darin bewegen kÃ¶nnen. Die Sohle ist schÃ¶n flexibel und SchweiÃ\\x9ffÃ¼Ã\\x9fe gibt es auch nicht (von innen mit ganz dÃ¼nnem Baumwollgewebe ausgekleidet). Absolut wasserdicht, tolle Farben, guter Sitz. Dadurch dass die Gummistiefel so flexibel sind (Sohle und auch Schaft) und nicht so hoch, kÃ¶nnen die Kinder super darin laufen und trampeln nicht durch die Gegend. Leicht an- und auszuziehen. Wir sind sehr enttÃ¤uscht! Die Stiefel 2x angehabt, 2x nasse FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe bekommen. Als Mutter eines kleinen Kindes bin ich sehr enttÃ¤uscht, schlieÃ\\x9flich kauft man Gummistiefel, damit die KinderfÃ¼sse trocken bleiben und nicht umgekehrt.  Es reicht aus, wenn es drauÃ\\x9fen etwas frischer ist, bei nassen FÃ¼ssen ist eine ErkÃ¤ltung vorprogrammiert. In der Corona-Zeit sehr \"erfreulich\".  Wenn man die Stiefeln betrachtet, findet man keinen Mangel. Der wird bei der BerÃ¼hrung der Stiefel mit dem Wasser gezeigt. Es war nicht einfach die Kontaktdaten des VerkÃ¤ufers zu finden. Ich wÃ¼rde am liebsten 0 Sterne geben.Update: Der VerkÃ¤ufer ist Toj Skandinavian Kids Fashion, vertrieben durch KK-Trade GmbH. Offensichtlich werden Ã¼ber dieses Angebot Stiefeln verschiener VerkÃ¤ufer vertrieben. Nach den vorherigen Bewertungen habe ich den Mantel 3-4 GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt und das war wirklich gut so.So sitzt er perfekt und ich kann noch dicke Pullover darunter tragen. Die Kapuze ist etwas klein, vor allem, wenn man eine MÃ¼tze darunter trÃ¤gt.DafÃ¼r habe ich mir aber schon seit lÃ¤ngerem einen wasserdichten SÃ¼dwester zugelegt. Der Mantel und Regenhut  sind eine unschlagbare Kombi.Den Mantel konnte ich auf mehreren mehrstÃ¼ndigen Regentouren auf seine Wasserdichte testen und bin vollstens zufrieden, da nicht ein Tropfen durch kam.Der Mantel wirkt sehr wertig und schÃ¶n verarbeitet. Sonst habe ich in wasserdichten Regenjacken das GefÃ¼hl in einer PlastetÃ¼te zu stecken, aber das ist hier nicht der Fall. Ich suche fÃ¼r unsere Kinde stets Schuhe die dem FuÃ\\x9f viel Freiraum bieten, minimal oder auch Barfusschuhe sind mir am liebsten. Diese Stiefel sind sehr leicht und wirklich fÃ¼r Gummistifel sehr flexibel, hÃ¤ngen nicht wie ein Klotz am Bein. Was mich sehr stÃ¶rt ist das oben kein Stoff ist mit Kordel zum zu ziehen damit kein wasser/Dreck in die Schuhe kommt. Das passiert bei meiner Tochter immer wieder und nervt sie. Da man das aber ja auch auf dem Foto sieht ziehe ich dafÃ¼r keinen Stern ab, eben gekauft wie gesehen (-; Die Stiefel riechen absolut gar nicht nach Chemie, das ist klasse. Allerdings \"fressen\" sich Erdspuren in die Farbe des Stiefels ein, Ã¤hnlich wie bei Kleidung, das finde ich bei Gummistifeln weniger schlimm da sie ja eh nicht zum schick sein gedacht sind (-: Super verarbeitetSieht hochwertig ausIst komplett wasserdichtHÃ¤lt auch den Wind ab, hÃ¤lt dadurch ziemlich warm. Ich trage sie bis ca 7 grad (mit einer fleecejacke darunter) und das ist vollkommen in Ordnung.Sie ist seit dem Kauf in stÃ¤ndigem Gebrauch, ich kann dir weiter empfehlen.GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 38 bestellt, weicht von der 36 nicht allzu viel ab. Sie passt, wer es gern etwas weiter mag, nimmt lieber eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer. Ich habe mich entschieden diese Gummistiefel fÃ¼r mein Kind zu kaufen, um die giftigen Inhaltsstoffe anderer Marken zu meiden. Wenn man daran glaubt, verdient ein Gummistiefel ohne gesundheitsgefÃ¤hrdende Stoffe natÃ¼rlich einen Bonusstern. Farbe, Funktion und Bequemlichkeit sind ebenfalls super. Deutliche AbzÃ¼ge gibts von mir wegen der Haltbarkeit. Nach 18 Monaten hat ein Schuh einen langen wasserdurchlÃ¤ssigen Riss ohne dass die Schuhe mit etwas anderem als Sandkastensand und Plastikspielzeug in Kontakt gekommen wÃ¤ren. FÃ¼r diejenigen die darauf spekulieren dÃ¼rfen, dass das Kind nach 18 Monaten eh eine neue SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe brauch kann ich eine Kaufempfehlung geben. FÃ¼r alle anderen eher nicht. Normally I fit 8.5 true to size but this time I\\'d try to half size up because these would be my beaters and I\\'m 17 still growing and when I got them they feel fit like an 8.5. Still satisfied with what came in looks amazing just a little size problem. If you\\'re gonna go true to size, go half up. ;) The way the materials are put together inside shoe, it\\'s very uncomfortable, not smooth. Cuts left foot where foot and toes come together. If I\\'d tried them on in a store I would have been able to feel it and not purchase. Not like the others I\\'ve bought before like these that I really liked. Won\\'t buy another pair. Will look for another brand, probably in a store where I can try on. Disappointing since I\\'ve really loved this brand and style before Bought these as a gift for my fiancee because heoves this brand and shoe style! He loves them!!!! He opened the box and was so happy. They fit perfect and as expected!!  Must buy! If you checking them out, don\\'t hesitate, BUY !! I\\'ve worn Reebok Classics size 7.5 for decades. Oddly, for the past 18 months, my feet have been growing and I\\'ve changed to size 8, then 8.5 and now size 9. Still happy with the shoes. These shoes are great. They are very comfortable for walking. And a perfect fit/size. Had the shoes a long time ago do you still feel great I have bought this model 5 times and now quality very disappointed. The nose of the sneaker came off after couple wearing. Cant contact with customer service and solve this problem( Es perfecto como la descripciÃ³n Leather item not fake. I pretty much like just everything about them.  Will be a little bit better when they stretch some. On their way back.  Ive always worn these and this pair was much narrower than I remember. I question authenticity. DiseÃ±o antiguo y calidad regular para el precio que tienen. No me han gustado nada, son mÃ¡s feas y simples en mano que en la foto. No las recomiendo. Eso sÃ\\xad, el tamaÃ±o habitual encaja perfectamente. Icvh habe schon einige Schuhe von Andrea Conti und war immer sehr zufrieden. Dieser Sneaker hat aber einen ganz anderen Schnitt, er ist vorne so eng da man Ã¼berhaupt nicht hineinkommt. AuÃ\\x9ferdem fÃ¤llt er viel kleiner aus. Article encore plus jolie qu\\'en photo, chaussure au top Fatal. Pague enviÃ³ rÃ¡pido (3 dÃ\\xadas) y me tardo casi un mesPor otro lado el producto bien, original y todo eso The sneakers smelled like plastic/synthetic not like authentic leather. I love Dolce Vita shoes and sneaks! These are no exception! However, I did have to exchange for a 1/2 size smaller from 6.5 to a 6. Not sure if my feet shrunk or these run a little big. I\\'m usually a true 6.5 in DV footwear!  Great style with the slight platform and I love the canvas and snake print mix media! I love how comfortable they are and so cute. I think they run a little big but, since they lace up itâ\\x80\\x99s not that big of a deal. I thought they were tieless laces but they are not. Good Cute style and very comfortable SchÃ¶ne warme Stiefel fÃ¼r Arbeiten im Freien. Ich habe ein paar Flip Flops fÃ¼rs schwimmen meiner Tochter gesucht die ihr gefallen und wo der Preis stimmt. Die Lieferung kam wie versprochen und sie sehen auch wie auf dem Bild auf. Meine Tochter hat die 33 und ich habe sie in 33/34 bestellt. Passen super und hat auch noch etwas platz. Denke eine Nummer GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fer wÃ¤re dann zu groÃ\\x9f. Sie stinken nicht also super. Ich wÃ¼rde sie wieder kaufen und meine Tochter ist happy. Muy bonitas, flexibles y cÃ³modas. Son las mejores, las mÃ¡s duraderas. Yo he repetido compra para mi hija por eso, porque ella estropea mucho los zapatos normalmente, pero estas se la han quedado pequeÃ±as  y estÃ¡n nuevas, y eso que tambiÃ©n las usa para piscina todo el aÃ±o! Recomiendo pedir un nÃºmero mÃ¡s pq dan poca talla. El precio por 13â\\x82¬ genial!! Das Material ist etwas fester als bei anderen FlipFlops, daher sind sie -wie bei uns genutzt- als Badeschuhe perfekt geeignet, da sie kein Wasser \"aufsaugen\". FÃ¼r lÃ¤ngeres Tragen sicher nicht so optimal, weil man dadurch eher schwitzt. Ich liebe die Ipanemas und meine MÃ¤dchen auch. Sie tragen sie seit GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 22 !Allerdings weise ich hier daraufhin, dass meine jetzt 5jÃ¤hrige Tochter die deutsche GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 27/28 trÃ¤gt. Bei den Ipanemas braucht sie aber in deutscher GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe mindestens 28/29. Estupendas SuperschÃ¶ner Kinder Flip Flop sitzt fest am FuÃ\\x9f und gibt guten Halt durch die zwei Riemchen. Unsere Tochter trÃ¤gt 32 diese hier habe ich in 33/34 gekauft und es passt perfekt Molto carini sono piaciuti a mia figlia, solo non calzano molto si puÃ² prendere anche un numero piÃ¹ grande e hanno una bella forma del piede Super bequemer Schuh. Tolle Optik, super leicht. Konnte ihn direkt fÃ¼r einen langen Spaziergang anziehen.Ein Stern Abzug weil immer die Sohle mit rauskommt wenn man die Schuhe auszieht. Riekerschuhe sitzen immer perfekt und sind mega bequem.GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 37 ist auch  GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 37. Toller Schuh! Passform ok. Das gelb gefÃ¤llt mir besonders gut! Wunderbar leichter Schuh mit einer angenehmen Innensohle. Tolle Farbe. Ich trage sie als bequeme Hausschuhe. SchÃ¶ner Schuh, leider nichts fÃ¼r breitere FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe Super bequemer Schuh. Super Schuh. SchÃ¶ne Farbe, sehr bequem gut verarbeitet. WÃ¼rde ich wieder kaufen. Farbe wie abgebildet, leider rollt sich die Schuheinlage beim gehen zusammen, da sie nur eingelegt ist. Sehr bequeme Schuhe Alles super - vielen Dank - gerne wieder La scarpa Ã¨ bella, leggera, cool, ma purtroppo la taglia Ã¨ davvero INDICATIVA. I 25 cm segnati sull\\'etichetta sono in realtÃ\\xa0 26 e oltre. Occhio alla misura. se las compre a mi hija y dice que son muy comodas y muy bonitas Muy mala calidad puestas 2 veces y ya estan como viejas. These shoes are cool in that if your kid is crappy at tying shoes, the shoes stay on whether or not they are tied.I was afraid the fit was going to be too snug but he was able to pull them on easily .  I\\'m going to preface my criticism with this: my son is hard on his shoes; he runs in his runner\\'s club about a 1.5 miles a day and then plays hard the rest of the time,so,the laces didn\\'t last two weeks, after about two months these are looking a bit worn and frayed on the upper near the toe, really its cosmetic.The sole is holding true its not pulling way or peeling like cheaper shoes do. the tread looks good  there is a lot of wear in the midfoot on the insert of the shoe so I am curious how long until the midfoot  cushioning starts to break down, so far so good they just look beat. When I saw these sneakers I had to get them because I love the way they looked.. but it fit my son feet some what small which I\\'m not thrilled about that because on the website said it runs true to size I did not want to even bother sending it back so I just gave it to my nephew.. These shoes looks super cute online, but the toe part is long and makes them look weird on my sons feet. But the bigger draw back is that on the inside of the heel is the bubble like cushion that sticks out like a 1/2 inch. He said it was very uncomfortable and rubbed on him. Cute and fun! Definitely not a shoe to run in, but good enough to throw on for errands. Fit a little big, but was expecting that. My son has two pairs of these shoes. He loves them and he wears them all the time. We have taken them to Disney and Universal multiple times and he says they are extremely comfy. Unfortunately these shoes runs very big, I really liked the color and material but their is no support on your feet when you walk/run or while doing any kind of sport My only complaint is that the tongue is attached to the sides of the shoe and can\\'t be pulled up to make it easier to put the shoe on.  Other than that (and I understand that is becoming a common feature in athletic shoes) I like them just fine. Habe mir den Schuh zum kleinen Preis bestellt, wirklich prima ist das neue Futter. Megaweich sogar die Sohle. Allerdings sollte man fÃ¼r diesen Schuh keine zu breiten FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe haben. Ich selbst habe schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe und mir passt er prima. Die Farbe braun stimmt so nicht ist eher olivgrÃ¼n. GefÃ¤llt mir aber recht gut. Absolute Weierempfehlung von mir. Belli, leggeri e morbidi all interno.... Calzano un po\\' piccoli... Consiglio numero piÃ¹ grande.... Presi in saldo, sodisfatta.... Sehr schÃ¶ner und gut verarbeiteter Araschuh. Material weich und angenehme Luftpolstersohle, Klasse Farbe, wirkt sportlich. Leider war der Schuh, trotz richtig bestellter GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe zu klein musste zurÃ¼ck geschickt werden. Schade. No es la talla correcta. Indica 42\\'5 y en la caja de indica 40\\'5. Una pena. Tutto okay... Gute QualitÃ¤t, GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt, angenehm zu tragen, Rot entspricht dem auf dem Foto, in Summe wirkt der Schuh jedoch am FuÃ\\x9f \"etwas Ã¤ltlich\" FidÃ¨les aux photos, belle qualitÃ©. La semelle est amovible et vous pouvez donc mettre la votre si nÃ©cessaire.Confortable mÃªme pour pieds larges. Super bequem. Sehr gute QualitÃ¤t Sehr schÃ¶ner Schuh Nachdem ich inzwischen bereits diverse Turnschuhe der Marke Nike bestellt und anprobiert habe, muss ich sagen, dass es mich nicht wundert, dass die hier vorliegenden \"Nike FS Lite Run 2 Damen Laufschuhe\" auch nicht passen, denn anscheinend hat sich die generelle Unsitte der zu kleinen Turnschuhe eingebÃ¼rgert, was sehr Ã¤rgerlich ist, ich meine, wenn man als Frau schon GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 43 (!) bestellen muss, obwohl man normalerweise 2 SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen kleiner trÃ¤gt, und die dann auch nicht passen, ich hÃ¤tte wahrscheinlich 44 oder 45 gebraucht!, das ist schon mehr als grenzwertig, normal ist fÃ¼r meine Begriffe anders. Ich frage mich, warum die Turnschuhhersteller an ihren Kunden vorbei produzieren, das kann es doch nicht sein! Aber bei den anderen groÃ\\x9fen Sportschuhanbietern ist es das gleiche Trauerspiel. Dabei sind gerade in dieser und der letzten Saison die Modelle so farbenfroh wie nie und man wÃ¼rde gerne sogar mehrere Paare kaufen, aber sie mÃ¼ssten natÃ¼rlich passen, das tun sie aber nicht. Entweder drÃ¼cken sie vorne von oben auf den groÃ\\x9fen Zeh herunter, was schmerzt, oder sie sind zu kurz und drÃ¼cken, schmerzen ebenfalls, oder sie sind insgesamt am Spann viel zu niedrig, so dass man bei geschnÃ¼rtem Schuh immer noch eine super breite SchnÃ¼rlasche hat, von weitem sieht das dann aus, als hÃ¤tte man ElefantenfÃ¼Ã\\x9fe, weil die Schuhe zu wenig Material haben um ganz geschlossen zu werden und das bei mir, die ich superschlanke FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe habe und jahrelang Ballett getanzt habe, einfach skandalÃ¶s! M.E. sollten die Nike Leute ihren Produzenten mal neue Schuhformen spendieren, die hier scheinen noch aus einem anderen Kulturkreis zu stammen in dem man PuppenfÃ¼Ã\\x9fchen hat, aber nicht die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe einer groÃ\\x9fen, westeuropÃ¤ischen Frau! Dieser Schuh ist ein Traum fÃ¼r groÃ\\x9fe und etwas breitere (keine zierlichen) DamenfÃ¼Ã\\x9fe, die ein paar Kilos mehr tragen mÃ¼ssen.Super bequem, trage sie den ganzen Tag bei der Arbeit, in der Freizeit, zum Nordic Walking, auf lÃ¤ngeren AusflÃ¼gen, zum Shoppen.Hab sie mir in drei verschiedenen Farbvarianten geholt. FÃ¼r die Farbkombi habe ich schon viele Komplimente bekommen! Toll fÃ¼r den Sommer! Ich habe den Schuhe bereits in zwei Farben, weil er einfach gut sitzt und dabei auch noch sehr schÃ¶n ist. Ich trage die Schuhe sowohl als Sportschuh und als Alltagsschuh. Ein super schÃ¶ner und bequemer Schuh den ich mir immer wieder kaufen wÃ¼rde. Sieht super das, passt perfekt und meine Tochter ist glÃ¼cklich. Sie hat Gr.35 und der Schuh 35,5 passt sehr gut. Das LaufgefÃ¼hl ist auch sehr gut. Der Schuh ist super bequem und sieht auch gut aus.Allerdings habe ich eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt.Ich habe eigentlich 39 und habe jetzt 40 genommen und er passt super!! Okk Ganz tolle Nike Schuhe!GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passte wie immer perfekt, geniale Farben und einfach ein Traum was den Tragekomfort angeht!!!WÃ¼rde sie mir auf jeden Fall wieder kaufen :) Super toller Schuh! Passt super. Sehr schÃ¶ne QualitÃ¤t. Sehr bequem zu tragen. Man lÃ¤uft wie auf Wolken! Nur zu empfehlen good condition its nice and comfortable. They are equal parts too big and too small. The proportions of these shoes are so off that the strap on the left was tight while the one on the right was super loose. They are pretty comfortable, the middle piece between my toes kind of hurt, but nothing the I wouldn\\'t get used to. Over all these shoes are ok, someone will love them: they just aren\\'t for me. These suck! I loved the look so I ordered a pair. Loved them (and hadnâ\\x80\\x99t had them long at all) then they came unstitched by the elastic. I thought maybe I did something wrong so I ordered another pair and everything was going great and it just happened again yesterday. Not only am I so so disappointed bc they are apparently not good quality but these were the cutest and went with everything! It makes me mad because I loved them so much They are well made, but the finger separator is too sturdy. It hurts so much I can\\'t wear them, even if I put bandages all over my fingers. I get a lot of blisters. It is impossible to loosen this thing up, especially during hot summers, when the feet swell. At this point they can only be a house decoration. For the price, these shoes are great.  I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly.  The straps feel extremely sturdy and they are pretty comfortable for being a flat shoe with little support.  The only complaint I have is that the bottoms of them is pretty slick. I ordered a size 11 and the shoe itself fit perfectly. But the strap with the buckle was way to short to go around my ankle. HOWEVER the straps were so soft and the shoes so comfortable I still recommend them. Just for people with smaller feet. I have never had a problem wearing anklets. They were a bit tight in the toe area,but they were cute and didnâ\\x80\\x99t give me any blisters wearing them throughout the day! I was able to take them to the water as well and it didnâ\\x80\\x99t damage the sole I was not feeling the color but I bought anyway. I run between a 6.5 and a 7 size. I ordered a 7 and they were way too small. I could have easily gotten an 8. I just gave them to my daughter instead of returning The footbed has minimal cushioning, but enough to keep your foot from sliding around.  The toe separator could be more comfortable.  They seem well made enough.  They\\'re cute.  They\\'re $10.  The sizing runs maybe a tiny bit small.  I usually wear an 11 in a shoe, and I often can get away with a 10 in sandals.  I got the 11 and was glad that I did.  The 10 would have been way too small. These are a steal! If you hate stiff, flat sandals then this is your answer. Super soft straps, thin but cushioned sole. My feet are very wide/thick and these are just perfect sandals for me. Wish they came in more colors! Itâ\\x80\\x99s not black. Itâ\\x80\\x99s dark blue. It first came a size ten. The bag said 7 but clearly it was a size 10. I would give it a worse rating for that part but itâ\\x80\\x99s actually a cute sandal. I prefer the navy blue and itâ\\x80\\x99s comfortable so I canâ\\x80\\x99t rate it lower. I like what I got and itâ\\x80\\x99s great quality. Passt perfekt fÃ¼r mein Sohn cette paire plait Ã©normÃ©ment Ã\\xa0 mon garÃ§on de 10 ans et pourtant c\\'est compliquÃ© de lui trouver des baskets qui lui plaisent Never ordered shoes online as I like to fit them first.  I have had asics in the past so I hoped they be the same as in the past as far as fit.  They fit great and are comfortable.  I am a smaller adult so my 5.5 size shoes are hard to find in stores unless I go to young boys shoes and the selection there isnt the greatest for adult colors.  I like them! My daughter absolutely loves them. She had the black pair for last season and outgrew them so she got the white ones and they fit perfect and looked sharp with her uniform! Excellent starter pair for my kid to wear for their first volleyball season. So happy with my purchase! I needed to buy slip ons after my shoulder surgery and these are the best! Great shoe for price!! These shoes are absolutely fabulous! They are lightweight and have great support and they are very comfortable. I just absolutely love them! The shoe is super comfortable and lightweight for walking.The eyelets for the shoelace are very thin and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure they are going to last if you try and tighten up the laces with repeated use and only time will tell. I purchased the navy blue ones and they have normal eyelets. Wear these no socks.  Massage therapist. Want more black my size (41/womenâ\\x80\\x99s 10) and some water proof.With Essentrics exercise, these are the best thing for balance, for my work and even walking the dogs! I needed a second pair of sneakers for work & soooo happy I bought these... very comfy Le he comprado estas Playeras  a mi hijo que usa el 40 e igual le quedan un pelin grandes pero un casi nada, son muy bonitas con vaqueros  y muy comadas alles gut, GrÃ¼Ã\\x9fe und Passform sind wie erwartet, Farbe entspricht der Erwartung.  FÃ¼r einen nicht zu breiten FuÃ\\x9f prima geeignet. Stabile Verabeitung. Ottima qualitÃ\\xa0, mio figlio contentissimo della scelta, molto soddisfatto Sehr gute QualitÃ¤t, so wie ich sie von geox gewohnt bin.WÃ¼rde ich wieder kaufenSpitzen Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnisDanke Soft, comfortable and beautiful shoes with a good fit.  The boy is overjoyed and happy and so am I.  Thanks so much. Der Schuh ist fÃ¼r diesen Preis sensationell. PRODOTTO DI OTTIMA  QUALITA\\'. CALZA IN MODO PIU\\' O MENO GIUSTO : PER CAPIRCI IN CONFRONTO AD UN\\'ALTRA CALZATURA DELLO STESSO NUMERO, CALZA UN PO\\' PIU\\' STRETTA. MA NEL COMPLESSO VA BENE. Son cÃ³modas y de calidad. Buenos materiales y buen envio SchÃ¶ne Schuhe. Sitzen sehr gut und gefallen dem Kind. Scarpe curate nel minimo dettaglio, fatte veramente bene, sono pienamente soddisfatto!!! Super QualitÃ¤t und gut verarbeitet. Macht einen rubusten und hochwertigen eindruck. Das FuÃ\\x9fbett, die Sohle und das Leder sind sehr weich. Mein Kind hat keine Druckstellen an dwn FÃ¼Ã\\x9fen navh dem tragen. AuÃ\\x9ferdem gibt der Schu einen guten Halt und sieht hÃ¼bsch aus. Die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe fÃ¤llt normal aus. Ich kann den Schuh empfehlen und wÃ¼rde ihn wieder kaufen. Die Farbe ist viel hÃ¼bscher als erwartet. Mehr Beere als Rot. Macht einen sehr guten Eindruck, gute Passform. Unser MÃ¤dchen zieht sie gerne an. Comode, morbide. Ottimo acquisto Me enviaron la talla equivocada! Yo ordene 23mex. 6ame. Y llegÃ³ en 22, y todo esto hasta MÃ©xico asÃ\\xad que no puedo enviarlos de regreso, tambiÃ©n rompieron la caja en aduana asÃ\\xad que ni caja original tengo!estoy tan desepcionada de verdad me gusta mucho el model, la calidad es buena no tengo quejas, es una moneda al aire. Los tenis bien,  el tamaÃ±o mal.  No le pongo 5 estrellas porque 2 veces me enviaron mal la talla. La primera vez pedÃ\\xad 3.5 y me mandaron 2.5 y los tuve que regresar, la segunda ocasiÃ³n pedÃ\\xad 4.5 y llego 3. These shoes were very nice but I ordered a half size larger as recommended by most of the reviews and they were definitely too big. I would say order your usual size. I did feel like the shoes had a bit of a forward tilt, which is maybe helpful for some avid runners? It felt unfamiliar to me so I did not re-order in my correct size. However, very stylish and appeared to be of good quality. Fit me well. I got a size 10 wide and they are comfy with plenty of room in the toe box. Its too cold to hike right now though so I\\'ll have to wait to get a true assessment. But walking on city streets is comfortable, with no pinch point or tight spots. No he encontrado ni una sola review de Ã©stas botas, ni siquiera existen para el fabricante, aunque el vendedor las describe como aptas para practicar el trail running. No se deberÃ\\xada practicar ningÃºn tipo de ejercicio con ellas, son inestables y el drop es demasiado alto. Perfectas para pasear, aunque cuidado en verano, el piÃ© puede alcanzar la temperatura del sol. No las recomiendo en absoluto, he tenido que pagar gastos de envio para recibirlas, ya que confiÃ© en la descripciÃ³n y es totalmente errÃ³nea. Ahora a pagar tambiÃ©n para devolverlas. Tardaron tres semanas y ademÃ¡s el transportista se negÃ³ a subirlas a casa porque \"estaba muy alto\". Toda una odisea. No compro mÃ¡s zapatillas en Amazon, mientras permitan la venta de Ã©stos productos sin control de calidad, en este caso de falsedad. Una vergÃ¼enza. EstÃ¡n muy bonitos, pero me mandaron la talla equivocada, se me hace injusto que esto pase en todos los pedidos, ya que la mayorÃ\\xada de los comentarios mencionaron este inconveniente, pensÃ© que tendrÃ\\xada suerte pero no fue asÃ\\xad, pedÃ\\xad 24 y me llegaron del 23. Los tendrÃ© que devolver . They are by far the more uncomfortable shoes ever!! Made for all terrain is correct , but more of a outdoor rough hike or shore walk along a rugged beach!!!I tried , and struck out , worn and can\\'t return. If looking for comfort, run, run far away , use whatever is covering then toes not a bolt in the opposite direction!! Now Go!!! I returned so many because the size was wrong, but this one is good . perfect fit . I Order a 9.5 size and it fit with bigger socks in Fall .  I usually wear a size 9 (41EU) . Son lindos, bien hechos pero son muy estrechos. Compre un 23 y termine regresandolo. Posteriormente compre un 23.5 y ese si me quedo bien. Compren una talla mÃ¡s. A pesar de ver los comentarios  referentes a quÃ© las tallas llegaban mal decidÃ\\xad confiar y probar suerte y en efecto llegan mal las tallas, no compren con estos vendedores  es mi recomendaciÃ³n.  el producto es bueno los humanos al seleccionar el nÃºmero correcto son pÃ©simos al parecer. Without  socks  upper weave rub my foot. Beautiful shoe. Hated to return them. very comfortable and cute! Comodissime grazie alla misura L non facile da trovare in altre marchePiÃ¹ leggere dei modelli precedenti (Tour 360)Vedremo la tenuta nel tempo AchetÃ©e en pointure 48. Dommage qu\\'Adidas ne les propose pas en France !!!Taille bien adaptÃ©e, chaussure lÃ©gÃ¨re et confortable After a couple wears this becomes an extremely comfortable spikeless golf shoe. They fit a little snug, but relaxes after a while. I won\\'t wear these in wet, soggy conditions because I don\\'t feel the traction would hold up with mud caked on the bottom. I\\'ve played two rounds in semi dry ground and the shoes were perfect. Only complaint - the tongue can be a bit stiff and can be annoying if not flattened out. Other than that it\\'s a great, stylish, comfortable summer golf shoe These are by far the most comfortable golf shoes I\\'ve ever owned, and possibly the most comfortable shoes of any kind that I currently own. The fit is perfect, and I love that they are so lightweight. I sometimes buy wide shoes because some designs are too narrow, but I got the standard width and it is perfect. I was unsure how I would like a spikeless design, but stability and traction were great. Combined with the amazing comfort, I will never go back to spikes. Once you try these, neither will you. Wow, I just finished 18 holes today with my new Adidas S2g golf shoes and they get an A+ for comfort, fit, and water repellant.  I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember the last time I put on a pair of shoes out of the box and felt completely comfortable wearing them.  4 hours walking the course and they were great from start to finish.  I hope this model is available when I need a new pair because these are worth a â\\x80\\x9cWill buy againâ\\x80\\x9d rating! Nice quality shoe but I have a couple problems with it that lead to a 2 start rather than 5.  BOA is using string instead of wire which it normally does and youâ\\x80\\x99re not able to get a proper tight fit. Second biggest issue is the fabric of the shoe lens it self to bunching up when you try to tighten it. One of the biggest issues is the tongue of the shoe is too puffy so when the BOA strings is trying to tighten it has to fight the puffiness, which lends to a loose fit.  Folks who love and use BOA on their shoes will understand. Last major issue which is the shoe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough arch support, atleast IMHO. On the plus side the sole of the shoe is one of the nicest Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen, but at this point, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll probably stick with Puma or FootJoy. Needed to replace my spikeless Nikes that had no grip left (Nike Roche G, so not much spikiness on the bottom to begin with).Played my first 18 with these today. They did the job pretty well. They were a little stiff at first, but broke in and softened up in no time at all. I love the new BOA style tying mechanism. It\\'s fun to just pull the knob up and flop your shoes off. They have great grip on the bottom, I felt very stable in my swings.I\\'d like them to have maybe just a little bit more cushioning. Nikes had a lot of suishy bounce in them. Don\\'t get me wrong, they\\'re definitely comfy. Nice and roomy. Played a full round and had zero comfort issues.Overall, really happy with these! Bought these because my Nikes (while really nice) make my feet ridiculously hot in the Florida weather. These shoes are definitely not for wet weather, but man are they comfortable! They seem like they will breathe really well, but only time will tell. I am very happy with the fit. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a 12.5 in all adidas shoes so I knew what size to order and they fit perfectly. Tried four different golf shoes, $200 range,  for the other named brand shoes.  This golf shoe won hands down on comfort, stability and fit.  Also, outstanding waterproofing that proved itself beyond my expectations.  Very much worth the money and style is great as well.  Great shoe to double for street walking. This is my third pair of Adidas golf shoes I have bought in the past six months.  I play year round, walk and carry my bag so fit and comfort is critical.  First two pairs are great so I expected the same with this pair.  Received them on Sunday and played in them on Tuesday.  After 12 holes my feet felt as if I was playing in leather soled dress shoes.  My heels are very low in the shoe and the ball of the feet feel bruised.  The support and comfort is completely different from my first two pairs of Adidas.  I will need to add inserts to play in these again.  Same price as the first two but comfort is not comparable. Absolutely comfortable right out of the box. Have been looking for comfortable sneakers that are not clunky and heavy like reebock,which I had been wearing. These are stylish and sooooo comfortable and not heavy, like walking on air.  Winner for sure! Five stars for sure!!This is my second pair of Propet and I think I\\'m in love just wore these for the first timeto an amusement park.  After thousands of steps my feet still felt like thy did when I left the house.They are my new go to.  I use my other pair for exercise walking. it\\'s like walking on a cloud and guess what?I\\'m up to almost 3 miles but always do at least 1 1/2 to 2 each time out and my shoes are NEVER A PROBLEM.I like Skechers as well but these offer a unique kind of sturdiness and support that\\'s very different. Wore these shoes for first time amd really like them. Very light weight and they are a bit large, because I ordered them half a size larger, so I could wear thicker socks. Worked out fine. I ordered these in XX-wide and the toe box is not very wide. They are more wide in the middle of the shoe. These must be intended for swollen feet/ankles not wide feet. I have problems with my feet swelling inconsistently (from normal to 4E from day to day).  I purchased the 4E to fit the fattest my feet get, but when the swelling is less they fit too.  The tongue of the shoe is not attached to the sides of the shoe so gives you more space, and with the laces I can tighten the shoe to fit my foot.  I love these so much that I bought 3 colors so I have variety.  They are comfortable to walk in and give good support. The shoe was in the wrong box.  It was too small.  To return it, I had to take it to the USPS store which I could not get to.  So I have a pair of shoes for the trash.  Last time I buy shoes from amazon. I have wide feet, especially in the toes area.  I have a devil of a time finding shoes that don\\'t cramp my toes.  Well, these did the trick for me.  They are good looking and comfortable.  Thank you thank you thank you. Lightweight but substantial! Fits well, but for a double extra wide, I\\'ve had wider shoes. Love the Prime Wardrobe try-before- you-buy option! Ensures you get what you\\'re looking for! Im in Love with these shoes...!..Ive been having lower back pain the last couple of months..I have bought several different types of walking shoes, Asics, Schetchers and tried On Cloud these are more comfortable. I nnormally wear a 9.5 or 10.. I decided to order 9.5  x-wide.. Ive never worn an xwide but i like the extra room i got with these..They fit perfect with plenty of room...I was worried they would old lady like, lol.. But i really like the look...And iâ\\x80\\x99m even wanting to walk for exercise now..Highly recommend.. Width good at 6XX but toe box hurts my little toe. Disappointed I had to return. .Mooie sneakers, maar ze is jets te groot The back material is already ripped on both sandals.  They look like they are last year\\'s shoes My son always complains that shoes arenâ\\x80\\x99t comfortable but he loves these and wears them every day. Great shoe that is also cool. I bought these for my son for Christmas, along with another pair that he liked more.  He has only worn these 3 times and it is already tearing at the toe tab. :*( Love the look and the feel ! Knit shoe is real comfy.  The ortho sockliner is great.  Overall lots of cushion.  Not really the most athletic shoe but great daily wear. Fit good, came with no box. But brand new. My husband loves the style, the way the sneakers fit and the color, (burgundy) is so pretty.I definitely recommend this shoe! Love them Feel great on Distinguishably casual. Great sneakers comfortable, feels half size larger. I purchased a pair of these shoes for my 6 yr old son to wear to school. They arrived on time. Put them on him this morning to go to school and these are some sharp, snazzy looking tennis shoes! They looked awesome on him! They fit just as expectedâ\\x80¦. But if you are in between sizes, go with the larger size. Always.If I had one complaint about these shoesâ\\x80¦. It would be on the top band where it says Afidas real bigâ\\x80¦. That part is semi snug on the kids foot. But after all, they are brand new and never been worn so maybe they just need a little time to get broken in some.Other than that, killer sharp little shoe! My son HAD to have these. The sole is cheap foam....and the traction has completely worn off. The bottoms are completely smooth now. They have no laces, so now they\\'ve  stretched out so bad, they come off very easily. I would not recommend! I love Addidas, but for the price  these are a fail. / Got for my 8 year old. Love them. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re comfortable and easy to put on.  And stylish for my 4th-grade boy These shoes seem well made, and the length seems true to size. However, the band across the foot is extremely snug, and my child had trouble getting his foot into the shoe himself. When he did get his foot in, the shoe was quite narrow and pinched his toes on the sides of the toe box despite having plenty of length. He usually wears regular width shoes, but these were too narrow for him. Second pair to own because they are comfortable. Easy to slide on. I  wear a women\\'s size  6. I bought a kids 4 1/2 and it fits perfict They fit well and are comfortable. My only complaint is that they arenâ\\x80\\x99t as breathable as I would of liked. My boys love these shoes.. itâ\\x80\\x99s all they will wear!! They tear up fast if you have rough boys.. but you should expect that from anything with rough boys.. ð\\x9f¤·ð\\x9f\\x8f¼â\\x80\\x8dâ\\x99\\x80ï¸\\x8fð\\x9f¤ª Poor quality tip of sneaker ripping apart,  not durable at all after only a month. Bought for my 6 years old 1st grade girl. My other kids sneakers didn\\'t do this all at. Very soft sole. My 7 year old wore the sole out in less than 2 months. My son loves them, he thinks he can run faster with these on. They fit great, & seem durable and comfortable. Look great too. Great shoes my son love it. Comodidad Great shoe, arrived quite late but product is good Bought these for my daughter who absolutely loves them. She is a picky person when it comes to shoes because she has a wide foot which can be hard to find a good looking great fitting shoe. They are perfect for her and she said she never wants to take them off so in all I  am glad I bought them. Quality: These do not seem like authentic adidas. They have a very strange look in person. I do not like them at all and nor does my child.Fit: I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend ordering these but if you do, make sure your kiddo has a narrow foot and order a half size up at least. My daughter really likes these shoes and does everything in them. It\\'s just unfortunate that the shiny stripes started peeling off within the first week of wear. Now 3 are peeling off and flapping around and it just looks really sloppy, as though she\\'s been wearing them for a couple years instead of a couple months! My mom got so concerned seeing the state of her shoes a couple weeks ago that she\\'s ordering her another pair ð\\x9f¤£. But, other than making me look like a negligent mom, they\\'re comfortable and lightweight and cute. Great looking shoe!  I love the look of these on my son.  As boys do though, he is pretty rough on clothes and shoes.  The fabric that covers the top of the toes (looks like of like mesh) got a couple of small holes in it after a couple of months and now after ~3-4 months of wearing them the entire piece of fabric on the top of the shoe is basically flapping in the breeze it\\'s pulled back so far.  The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok, so I guess more of a cosmetic issue, but still annoying.  Not sure I\\'d buy these again simply because of that, but I did love them for the first couple of months! I thought adidas would offer a quality material but my 6 year old son already was able to wear it out the tip of the shoes within two months. All he has been doing with the shoes is walking, running, biking , playing in recess outside in school. He does not play soccer so kicking or something like that is not the reason why the fronts torn out. Looked great to start but after a few short weeks the front plastic toe started to crack open. Typical daily use! Would not recommend this product. The sandals were very cute, extremely undersized. My granddaughter wears a size 3 and these wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even go on her foot. She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have a wide foot so they should have at least went on width wise. To me they looked more like a size 1. I returned them. I had bought them for a trip and there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t enough time to reorder. Very narrow at the toes. The beading was already curling up when we received it. Poorly sewn. Very low quality materials. Had to return themRight away. When I saw the shoes I liked them because they would match a dress I bought for my daughter and I to have our family photos done. When the shoes arrived I was immediately disappointed at how the shoe felt over all. When I went to try them on my daughter, she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even slide her feet in because the straps at the front were too tight. I even put lotion on her feet to see if they would slide in easier and thought she just needed to break them in. My daughter started crying after having them on for less than 5 minutes. Her feet had the strap marks imprinted on the tops of her feet for about 30 minutes. My daughter is very petite and has little feet. We ordered the sandals and they are super cute but the straps that go over the foot are ridiculously small. My daughterâ\\x80\\x99s foot wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t fit. We exchanged for a larger sizeâ\\x80\\x94 the same problem! We have never run into this issue before with any shoes or sandals. Disappointed, as they are so adorable. Super cute shoes my granddaughter is wearing with her summer dress to a wedding. My daughter bought several sizes because we believed the reviews, just by your normal size. They are very pretty and stylish,  however, I had to get them a size bigger because the front of her foot would not go in properly. These LOOK cute, but the quality is terrible. One of the straps broke after a month....3 days after the return window. My 5yr old is so disappointed ð\\x9f\\x98\\x9e  don\\'t waste your money or time on these. As far as the shoe size goes it is true to size but the strap over the toes is too tight. My child is pretty slim and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have fat feet so I think the toe strap area could be a bit bigger. These were really cute. However, they are too narrow so I had to return. My daughter loves them!  Super sparkly and cute!! QualitÃ¤t ist gut, roch etwas streng nach Gummi, haben ihn 1 Tag ausgelÃ¼ftet vorm tragen,dann wÃ¤r\\'s gut. Guter Tragekomfort sagt mein Sohn,guter halt, Fussball Spielen im Garten geht auch,bisher keine Naht o.Ã¤. gerissen, hÃ¤lt was aus! Sollte evtl 1 Nr grÃ¶sser bestellt werden, fÃ¤llt schmal aus, und eine 39 ist quasi eine 38,5.....ansonsten top! BuenÃ\\xadsima calidad y son preciosas la talla es la que se usa habitual SuperschÃ¶n. Toll ausgefallen. Schnelle Lieferung. Jederzeit wieder. El diseÃ±o muy buenos pero las tallas confusas para mexico These are nice looking and feel solid, however, my right boot came with a 1\" long defect on the right side near the toe stitching that appears to have had an attempt to be \"fixed.\" I\\'ll be returning these unfortunately.**UPDATE 12/02/2018**  After some thinking and looking around for other black boots, I decided to give this pair another shot.  After all, I liked their look and design, and figured I should give them another try.  My new pair came basically free of any defects to the leather.  However, the white stitching around the toe area wasn\\'t quite as clean and neatly done as I would expect from Ariat.  I know these are only $150, but still, this kind of issue should be easily preventable.  Other than that, these boots are very comfortable, and took very little time to break-in.  Maybe a couple of days.  And to get around the slippery leather sole, I took them to a Cobbler who applied a thin rubber layer over the leather sole.  It was a great fix that I had not previously heard of!  I hate leather soles. These boots are comfortable and last a long time. Very well constructed. Got as Christmas gift and got the same size as last pair. He loved them Great boots The boots look great. I accidentally ordered a EE in width but Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I did because they are still a little tight. Okay - this may not be a name you are framiliar with, I was not.  But this is my second pair and finally I am not wearing out one side of my shoes and my feet no longer hurt.  I got my first pair from the orthopedic shoe / soles and am not looking back. Yes, I recomend this product. Typical of most men - I buy the same shoe over and over again. The sole is different but cures my issues with pain in my Achilles. I like the shoes very much and seem to be high quality Sizing is right on. They are super comfortable and I feel like my posture is better when walking. AchetÃ© en rose elles sont parfaites. Comme sur la photo.Taille bien.Ma fille est ravie Parfait ma fille fait 25 et je sais mettre un doigt derriÃ¨re son talon. A couple of friends praised Hokaâ\\x80\\x99s and how comfortable they are so I decided to cough up the extra money for a pair since I have a bad knee. They are ok tennis shoes but the thick sole seems more for looks then comfort so value for money is a bit disappointing. Voleci!! Ottimo! El envÃ\\xado tardÃ³ menos de lo esperado pero la caja venÃ\\xada en una bolsa y la caja estaba en un mal estado, los tenis no me quedaron bien por tener el empeine alto. Bought these to replace an old set.  Not the best looking, but they fit as expected and are well built turf boots. Great cleat.. light weight .. great on the field turf.Only downfall... very difficult to get on because of the tight sock material on the ankle.. have to use a shoehorn to get them on.  Know way I was fitting my foot through there.  Overall very pleased with the product Tal y como lo esperaba It was good The good - shoe is light and flexible with enough padding in the heel so you donâ\\x80\\x99t bruise your heel when playing on really hard fields. Length was true to size. Fun colorThe bad - I stopped wearing them after five practices due to how hard they are to get on. Takes forever to get my feet through the upper sock thatâ\\x80\\x99s attached to the shoe. They made it too small without enough stretch. Some type of neoprene would have been a better choice vs ribbed cotton. The shoe itself is A bit narrow even for a medium width foot. They werenâ\\x80\\x99t painfull  but they werenâ\\x80\\x99t comfortable either. They arrived a day before a soccer tournament I had, they feel extremely good, the built in compression socks, is really comfortable, I used them in real grass with some patches and didn\\'t have any issues with the traction and hold in on, I also tend to slide a little bit the foot and when having to accelerate didn\\'t have any problem. After like 20 minutes of playing I start having blisters on my backheel, I think I still have to break them in, but meanwhile they look amazing, they have really nice traction, I\\'m hoping they can break in quickly. Great shoe for turf fields. My only issue is that you must wear socks the come well over the ankle cuff and they have to be on the thicker side or the shoe will rub your achilles raw. Otherwise the shoes offer good support and I\\'m very pleased with them. I normally am a size 12-13 so I went with a 12.5.  It is hard to buy shoes online without trying them on first, so I gave it a go.  I took them out for a game last night.  They are very comfortable for turf, however, given the large size, my touch was heavy and I couldn\\'t connect with long passes (getting under the ball).  My lesson learned, try the size before you buy. Runs huge. Returned three times for different sizes until the size was decent. No support on footbed. Not impressed. Their market should stick to outdoors cleats of which Adidas is king! (Although the newer version of beloved outdoor clear Nemesis 19.3 is terrible on the ankle support. Please go back to the 18.3! None of the travel soccer boys like the new version.) I wanted a nice tennis shoe for the fall and this fit the bill. I love the colors and theyâ\\x80\\x99re comfortable too. I listened to the other buyers and bought a smaller size to be safe. I wear a 7 and bought it in a 6.5 and itâ\\x80\\x99s a good fit. They run SO big. I wear an 8.5. Ordered these shoes and they fit more like a 9 or 9.5. I recommend going at least one size down.These shoes are cute, but they look very bulky on my feet. Beautiful sneaker! Very comfortable! Runs a full size large. I normally wear 9.5-10 but found that a 9 was the best fit in this style. Color is beautiful dusty rose. Ya tenÃ\\xada unos en otro color pero con el cambio de uniforme necesite estos y como si los hubiera comprado en Adidas Iâ\\x80\\x99d been eyeing these are they are unbelievable. Seller was awesome, quick shipping.  Get them!!! They have great arch support and I love the color. A bit tight on my right heal, but long socks help relieve that. I usually wear a 7.5-8. Based on other reviews I ordered a half size smaller and went with a 7. These fit pretty well, however I think a 6.5 may have been too small. I absolutely love love love these shoes. I want a pair in every single color. Great quality, stylish, lots of compliments. Love these.  So cute and comfortable. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0they are true to size. so comfortable and stylish. beautiful color. Love them WE LOVE IT. I bought a toddler size 8 for our 32months old daughter. She absolutely love them! Our favorite part of the shoes is the thoughtful design â\\x80\\x94 one side of the tongue is attached to the lace cage so itâ\\x80\\x99s very easy for our daughter to put them on herself! We are buying another pair!! These run really small. My grandson wears a size 4 toddler and size 6 was tight and made his feet hurt. Not for kids with chubby feet!  My son has narrow feet but these would not work for wider feet.  These helped my 15 month old run all over the place!  I felt good about him having nice support.  Great shoe! Love these ASICS for our 3 year old daughter.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been buying these sneakers since she started walking.  Love that they are easy and quick to put on, and the colors match most of her clothes.  Her feet are a little wide, and this brand fits her better than Nike and Adidas sneakers.  She loves that she can put them on by herself now. These are comfy shoes that stay well on my kid\\'s feet and are easy for her to put on. The strap seems to have good life in it, but they (obviously, as white shoes) will look new for exactly one day. I would buy them again for daycare shoes, though. We started buying ASICS instead of Stride Rite due to some quality issues we had with one or two pairs. This shoe holds up well. When my daughter grew out of it, we sized up and ordered another pair. Was recommended these shoes because my son is a toe walker. I think it is helping a little but only time will tell. Shoes are great so far! Found these sneakers in a list of the best sneakers for the flat feet, thought they have good arch support, but nope... No arch support at all, the sole is absolutely flat(( Maybe it\\'s not the manufacturer\\'s fault of the false advertising, but anyways flat soles are not good for athletic shoes, so 4 stars. Though they look well made. Iâ\\x80\\x99m an ASICS shoe fan myself and these for my toddler did not disappoint. So stinking cute with the baseball design. He wears them almost daily and theyâ\\x80\\x99ve held up great! Seriously considering ordering the next size up. My twins have wide feet and these shoes are perfect for them. This is their 3rd pair. I walk 10 km/day, for the las two years I\\'ve been using Air Monarch IV, and this  shoes feel more comfortable. Quality is top. And delivery by Purolator was excellent and fast (3 days before expected). Great look and feel.This is my second pair.Will buy again great price. Those shoes make your feet look quite wide. I was not expecting it to be so wide... Regardless the shoe is nice and clean. tres beau soulier et bon prix Comfortable Good quality running shoe Die Lieferzeit war zwar etwas lang, aber das Warten hat sich gelohnt. Ein sehr schÃ¶ner Schuh, passt wie angegossen. Der First pair of addias for many many years..will buy addias  again... TrÃ¨s bon Just the worst! I was a little cautious at first. $99 for calfskin leather uppers. Made in Italy so I decided to order a pair. Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I did. Very comfortable with generous arch support. The sole is a proprietary dainite-like sole. The famous rubber studs. It was very grippy and it seems hard wearing which I like.  Now for the leather. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a smooth leather. At first glance I thought it was a waxy suede or a rough out leather. It has a matte like finish. I do like it. It pairs very well with a suit or casual wear. Donâ\\x80\\x99t wear any white socks. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s some dye issues with the first few wears. The shoe is of good leather and strong. However the colouring of the shoe is not smart. It looks very odd.Plus the shoes did not have the blue sole but covers black rubber patch. That would make it stronger from friction damage but just mentioning that it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t as presented.I returned for above reason and because the shoe was tight besides saying wide size. Shoe looks to be of excellent quality. I normally wear a 11.5 W. Only an 11 or 12 was available, no half sizes. The length fits  perfect but it seems to be a little wider than I expected. Overall it is a great looking shoe. Yo quisiera la misma bota zai (10) y el mismo color ojo vino favor contestarme para saber di la pido de nuevo This is a beautiful shoe, the top of the shoe - is extremely hard leather and cuts into the back of foot.. hard to wear or enjoy, was bleeding after one day on both feet.. this is my second purchase of this shoeâ\\x80¦ although love the style itâ\\x80\\x99s a waste Excellent, color perfect, fit perfect, thank you! Size 13 US wide is slightly small on the 12.5 side. Width is a bit snug at the toes. Pull loop broke on first pull - could be better. I sent them back as they didn\\'t fit Nice color. A little overpriced for the quality and workmanship. Shoes are really worth the price and are comfortable. Real leather. Arrived in good condition, within specified time limit. It fits perfectly. Just loving it solo much!! toll verarbeitet, schÃ¶nes Leder, eine weiche Sohle, also insgesamt bequem - aber leider nichts fÃ¼r kleine FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe. Ich habe 36 und auch so bestellt, doch gehen fast alle Hersteller dem Trend nach, GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen nach oben zu Ã¤ndern. Wenn dann allerdings von unten - also 35 oder 35,5 nichts nachkommt - sieht es fÃ¼r uns KleinfÃ¼Ã\\x9fige sehr schlecht aus. Meist rutscht dann auch noch die Ferse aus dem Schuh, hier gehts gerade noch. Finde ich sehr schade, man mÃ¼sste ja von diesen \\'GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen keine Unmengen produzieren aber sie auch bedienen. ZunÃ¤chst das Positive, das Leder ist tatsÃ¤chlich angenehm weich, das TragegefÃ¼hl ist sehr angenehm, weil der Schuh eine weiche gepolsterte Sohle hat. Das war es dann leider auch schon. Die VerschweiÃ\\x9fung von Sohle und Leder lÃ¤sst nach nur 5 Monaten deutlich nach, Feuchtigkeit und KÃ¤lte dringen ein. Die Nieten fÃ¼r die SchnÃ¼rsenkel sind so scharfkantig, dass ich bereits mehrere Paar SchnÃ¼rsenkel zerschlissen habe. Leider ein Fehlkauf, fÃ¼r 80,- â\\x82¬ sollte die QualitÃ¤t/Haltbarkeit um LÃ¤ngen besser sein. Schuhe kamen pÃ¼nktlich an, wie gewohnt von Amazon.Der Schuh an sich sieht super aus, passt perfekt und riecht nach Leder, was jedoch nicht heiÃ\\x9ft das er echt Leder ist. Mir fehlt leider der eindeutige Hinweis auf echt Leder, jedoch geben die Kanten am Schuh Hinweis darauf da diese aufgetaut und nicht glatt sind. Eine Anleitung zur Pflege wÃ¤re ganz nett gewesen, aber die kann man sich ja im Internet raussuchen ;-)Ansonsten super verarbeitet, nichts steht weg alles sitzt, kleiner heller Fleck an der Seite aber fÃ¤llt fast nicht auf. Die Schuhe kamen gut verpackt an. Sind auch relativ bequem- mir etwas zu eng. Aber es ist ja Leder und weitet sich hoffentlich nocht etwas. Auch sind mir die SchÃ¼rsenkel zu kurz. - Deshalb ein Stern Abzug! Diese kÃ¶nnten bei diesem Schuh etwas lÃ¤nger sind dann wÃ¤re es perfekt. La piel es muy suave, y estÃ¡n bien acabadas. El color es mÃ¡s bonito que en la foto, es un azul Ã\\xadndigo precioso. Calza mas bien holgado, pero en mi caso no para pedir un nÃºmero menos. Como pega la suela, que es un poco rÃ\\xadgida y creo que va a resbalar. Son muy cÃ³modas y espero ponÃ©rmelas mucho. Tolle QualitÃ¤t, weiches Leder und super leichte Schuhe. Mit jedem Tragen dehnt sich das Leder, so dass die Schuhe immer bequemer werden traumhaft! super bequem! ich laufe auf wolken! war auf der suche nach einem anderen modell der firma... werde nur noch andrea conti kaufen. Farben sind wie abgebildet. Gute QualitÃ¤t auÃ\\x9fer an der Hacke ist eine VerstÃ¤rkung der Naht. Deshalb einen Stern weniger. Quedan muy bien, cÃ³modos y un color vibrante. Der Schuh ist angenehm zu tragen, weil das Leder weich und leicht ist. Die Farbe sieht genauso aus wie abgebildet. Die bestellte GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt gut. Tremenda desilusiÃ³n ya que al a menos de mes y medio ya se rompieron, pensÃ© que la marca darÃ\\xada la calidad esperada. Okay, las comprÃ© para mi mamÃ¡ ya que le gustaron.Ella es del nÃºmero 4 en talla de mujer asÃ\\xad es que tenÃ\\xada dudas sobre el ajuste de la talla 25 que comprÃ©. PensÃ© que serÃ\\xada o muy grande o la forma seria bastante ancha por ser para hombre.La realidad es que le quedaron bastante bien y sÃ\\xad, son un poco grandes pero no se ven de payaso ya que en todo caso, le ayudan a no tener los dedos a ras de la suela, tampoco se ven varoniles.La calidad es buena y el precio es bueno. Entrega un poco tardada para ser un producto de esta categorÃ\\xada, mas sin embargo valiÃ³ la pena.Te puedes balar con ellas o incluso salir a la playa y se ven bien, ya que no son las tÃ\\xadpicas chancas corrientes o las sandalias de mal gusto pero de moda (CROACS) EstÃ¡n muy anchas, pero ademÃ¡s hay una mas ancha que la otra. Y lo peor es que se me pasÃ³ la fecha de devoluciÃ³n PedÃ\\xad la talla de miEsposo y le quedaron muy apretadas. Hubiera pedido un punto mÃ¡s para que entrara las Agusto el pie. Es de pie gordito, talvez un pie flaco no tenga problema. En pie gorro definitivamente no las pueden usar de su talla. Todo lo demÃ¡s se ve bonito y buena calidad Producto de mala calidad, venÃ\\xada como roto lo sintÃ©tico de un costado, de ambas sandalias, si pueden no lo compren, no vale la pena Las sandalias las comprÃ© para mi hijo.Ã\\x89l usa talla muy grande. En esta marca adquirimos talla adecuada y comodidad I am giving 4 stars for comfort, though the straps look like its made of plastic. I am a big fan of the colors they have used. Also, it fits beautifully.  So 4 stars from me. Funciona pero la suela se despinta casi al primer uso y el material del plÃ¡stico da mal olor SÃºper comodidad y de buena calidad, me quedaron como lo esperaba, el material es ligero y cÃ³modo. El color azul es muy padre. Amplimamente recomendable. I PUSHED my husband into looking at these because he likes to walk on snowy days and has a neuropathy issue in his feet and he makes me nervous on snow and icy patches.  Because of artificial hips and some back issues, he also has trouble with tie shoes so these seemed perfect.  I own two pairs  of Merrillâ\\x80\\x99s and LOVE THEM so I really worked to convince him that he should give these a try. HE LOVES THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He loves how they feel, how they look and how they work for him.  These are probably the most expensive shoes he has ever bought but he will tell you worth every penny.  Iâ\\x80\\x99m delighted because...well...I was right. Replaced another pair that wore out after 5 years of heavy useThe soles are not slip resistant like kitchen shoes made with slip resistant soles but my husband uses them anyway due to comfort Really liked the shoe - nice construction, looks good, seems well-made.Only problem that it was was narrow and tight even in a size 11 (I normally wear a 10.5).So snug that I could barely get the shoes onto my feet.  Even getting them off was a struggle.Almost too long in length so the next size up would not have solved the problem.For the right feet, these probably will be a nice pair of shoes. I bought these to replace a pair of slip-ons I\\'ve worn for twenty years and these have become my go-to footwear. They are warm, waterproof, and have provided perfect traction on ice and snow. I\\'m not a graceful person, so if they\\'re keeping me standing on slick surfaces, then I know they really work. The fit is a little snug, but not uncomfortable at all. If you want a pair of shoes you can slip on and go anywhere in regardless of weather, then these are it. I owned a pair of Merrell shoes that I wore for years until they wore out and I bought these as a replacement. They fit great, are extremely comfortable, and look good. I wanted a pair of slip-on shoes that I could wear to the office or on a hike and these succeed in both. They are nice looking leather and look like regular black leather shoes, but they also have specially made high-grip soles which will do well in winter ice. They are very comfortable, look good, and I highly recommend them. I\\'m very happy with Merrell shoes and when these wear out in ten years I\\'ll probably buy another pair from them. I\\'ve only had them for a week, however they are comfortable and seem well made.  I like that they are slip-on and quite easy to slip into.  Just yesterday I did encounter some ice on my sidewalk.  I was very pleased with the traction, the ice+ tread does work!  I wear these to the office as well and they are not too hot or cold. After a year of wear these still slip on tight with a satisfying \"thuck\".  The heal tops haven\\'t broken down even though I rarely pull them on with my hands - just stuff my feet into them.  Very comfortable, don\\'t wiggle or slip, but aren\\'t tight or binding, great on snow and other infirm surfaces, and great looking with a pair of jeans.  From afternoon walks to bar hopping, these are the first shoes I grab.  I generally wear a 12D even though my feet are a little narrower than that with a high instep, and these fit really well. I bought these for my husband - his second pair.  He wore his first pair for about 5 years until they wore out.  A good looking sturdy shoe for walking and working outside.  He says there is no \"breaking in\" period.  He is very loyal to the Merrill brand and believes they are a good value. They seem to run true to size when compared with other similar Merrell shoes I\\'ve owned. I\\'ve owned 3 or 4 pairs of Merrells, and was impressed by each one. Pretty decent grip. I live in a land of ice for 5 months out of the year, and while I wouldn\\'t wear these for extreme excursions, getting around in parking lot or on a sidewalk with patches of ice, these aren\\'t a bad choice. I had been looking at this particular color and size show for 18 months. They finally came down a smidge to the price I was looking for. This pair fits perfectly, and the soles of this pair are perfect for winter season coming up. (Well, I live in Phoenix Metro. Before I lived in COS, these would have been perfect.) I do recommend this pair completely, and the vendor was terrific. Product arrived earlier than anticipated. This shoes is perfect to size The heel was uncomfortably tight. Just not the Reebok shoe I remember. I was looking for a solid black sneaker for my child to wear to private school.  These are comfortable, fit well, are adjustable and reasonably priced. Normally I love Classics for my kids but this one was only worn for a week when the bottom fell off. ONE WEEK!!!! I was really disappointed. Nice sneakers and comfortable.  Good for the price. My  niece have have one of those since she is in school , she is 7 years old now, so  hers are a little old and small, so i showed her some others of a diferent brand , and she told me: no, buy my the same one, and i reply, but those others are beautifull and pretty, and she  told me; no, mine are more confortable, and pretty. I want the same one. So i purchase it again. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0They said the shoes was made in Vietnam and I received it just now and it shows made in China..  am so disappointed ð\\x9f\\x98\\x9e ð\\x9f\\x98ª When i was young these used to be three best school shoes...now my daughter has a pair love them, just what i had expected looks sturdy as they are fir school in septemberWe love them Good PROOttimo per consegna in anticipo di un giorno rispetto a quella prevista.Modello corretto, taglia corretta.CONTROIl colore delle scarpe Ã¨ diverso da quello della foto.La scarpa destra presenta rigature sulla pelle esterna ed interna come da foto e non aveva l\\'inserto per mantenere la forma, sembra sia una scarpa esposta.Non richiederÃ² un reso ma ritengo decisamente preferibile meno solerzia nella consegna e piÃ¹ correttezza nella coerenza con quanto esposto nella foto e nella qualitÃ\\xa0.Inoltre sullo store Lumberjack il modello con il colore che mi Ã¨ arrivato Ã¨ venduto ad un prezzo inferiore. Comincio nel descrivere la scarpa, che Ã¨ di buonissima fattura e il cui unico tallone d\\'achille Ã¨ forse la suola, meno confortevole del modello Timberland, che ha un minimo di \"rimbalzo\", ma diciamo che non da fastidio a meno che non ci facciate i km in una sera.Per quanto concerne gli accorgimenti da seguire:- Se non avete giÃ\\xa0 provato la scarpa, scegliete un numero in meno del vostro, calzano larghe, non tanto dalla  punta ma dal tallone, escono proprio. Io porto il 42 e il 41 mi sta bene.- E\\' una scarpa che va portata dal calzolaio, appena indossata vi accorgerete che non Ã¨ un cuoio che cede facilmente al vostro piede, e a meno che non vogliate delle vesciche sui mignoli e sui talloni (come successo a me), portatele da un calzolaio e fatele mettere \"in forma\", un paio di giorni.Al ritorno, vi accorgerete di quanto la scarpa calzi meglio, e non soffrirete per nulla.La sto usando spesso, e l\\'ho acquistata da circa una 20ina di giorni.Acquisto consigliato, ma seguite questi accorgimenti. Ho una scarpa identica ma di quattro anni fa, pertanto ho fatto l\\'ordine abbastanza sicuro che sarebbe andata bene. Questa ha la suola con le stesse misure ma Ã¨ importabile tanto Ã¨ stretta. Non capisco se Ã¨ un difetto ma stando al venditore il modello potrebbe essere stata modificato. Consiglio l\\'acquisto alle persone che hanno un piede affusolato, poco largo e con un collo stretto. Certamente nella descrizione andrebbe puntualmente segnalata la cosa, ma cosÃ¬ non Ã¨. Infine il reso NON E\\' GRATUITO pertanto per quanto mi riguarda MEGLIO ANDARE IN NEGOZIO. Nulla da dire sulle scarpe (sono nuove e calzano perfettamente), ma una certa opacita sulla tomaia fa immaginare che non siano appena uscite dalla fabbrica, lucide e splendenti come quelle che si vedono in foto. In piÃ¹, fra l\\'una e l\\'altra ho notaro una leggera decolorazione, come se una scarpa fosse stata esposta alla luce di piÃ¹ dell\\'altra. Non perfette, quindi, ma comunque senza difetti vistosi che ne pregiudichino l\\'uso e per il prezzo pagato (52 euro) vanno piÃ¹ che bene le scarpe tipo barca della Lumberjack sono anni che le uso nel periodo estivo per la loro comoditÃ\\xa0, leggerezza e durabilitÃ\\xa0. Uso lumberjack da anni e mi sono trovato sempre bene,bello il colore e calzano perfettamente io porto la 43.. Le lumberjeck di questo modello sono veramente sempre di ottima fattura.Complimenti al venditore.43 euro spesi bene. Ottimo prodotto, un po\\' largo, sistemato con soletta. Le dimensioni a mio avviso non rispettano la descrizione della ditta. Arrivato nei tempi giusti. Ne avevo giÃ\\xa0 un paio ora consumate, le ho ricomperate perchÃ¨ ci cammino bene. Prodotto conforme I have almost 100 pair of shoes and these are among some of the ones I only wear occasionally... because they hurt and leave blisters on my feet. I even changed the insoles thinking that might help but, no cigar! If you\\'re the type that wears socks then, maybe these are for you but, I live in Florida and socks are just WAY TOO HOT.... So unless I\\'m wearing boots, I go barefoot in all my shoes. Now these look good but, fall short in the comfort area. \\'Just my two cents... The first walk with these shoes the soles started to crumble off like maybe the rubber was not hardened, or just too soft to be used on a shoe sole.  It was minor at first and I let it go, now 3 months later (I do not wear these every day) there are major sections of the sole completely worn off, and a support wire inside has popped out.I sent pictures and a description to the dockers customer service email and have never heard back. Great looking shoe, light weight and was very comfortable after i change out the insoles. The insoles that come with them are not good. Add another 10 bucks to you shoes and they are great. Took almost 2 weeks for delivery and were a little to large. Great shoe at a great price! Pefectos...quiero otros! Perfect fit. Super lightweight shoes. Fits well and is very light. Great fit looks and feels great I wear size 9, but these beautiful runners fit more like a size 10 N, so I retrned them, very disappointed! Cole Haan Women\\'s Zerogrand Overtake All Terrain Wr Trail Running Shoe. Normally wear ASICS size 9B. Tried size 9, then 9.5 both were very narrow. Unfortunately I returned both pairs.  I tried the menâ\\x80\\x99s version size  7 and they worked out just fine. I love these sneakers!I ordered a half size up because Cole Haanâ\\x80\\x99s sneakers generally runs smallish.But they are comfortable enough for long hikes and all day standing, while being stylish.Iâ\\x80\\x99ll buy sneakers more soon! The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0Son hermoso y muy cÃ³modos. Very comfortable shoes! I like the color , quality is good ! My daughter was unsure of them at first, she has sensitive feet, I convinced her to give them a go and they are awesome. I read there were sizing issues so I bought to what was recommended but they are just her foot size, and as we were off on holiday could not change for the next size up.I will be getting these again though as I\\'m told they are very comfortable. ð\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f Ottimo prodotto,  l\\'ideale per il mare e per giocare all\\'aperto.Garantisce una buona presa sul terreno tenendo il piede fresco. Las sandalias son muy cÃ³modas, las usa en casa todo el dÃ\\xada luego del colegio, se ajustan muy bien a sus pies. My daughter loves these, and she is picky about what she will have on her feet.Thank you!

The actual colors are gray, purple, and coral pink.  Hope that helps someone!  Please mark if this review was helpful. Very comfortable and well worth the price!  Teva is a very good company. The shoes are very well constructed. My future daughter in-law liked mine so much I bought her a pair as well. She could not get over that they are kids shoes as she and I have small feet and it\\'s hard to find nice shoes in the stores in our size. The caption under the description of these shoes advises to get one size under your actual size, as these run big. And the caption is correct, I could really wear a 4 in these, but  bought a 5 and they are actually a little big and I normally wear size 5.. But I love them !! I like them, and they provide good grip and protection while being airy for my sweaty baby. LOL But there are two problems. They are verrrrry stiff. I cant bend them, without feeling like they might start spiting. I guess that makes them a little tougher? Also, we now have about 5 pairs of the same size shoes for our 17 month old daughter. They all seem to be pretty close aside from these. They are a little big. The issue with is, for the most part they are meant to be worn without socks. The shoes being to big, and being worn without socks will cause the lacing system/tongue to bunch up and hurt.  I would say if you could, order two on amazon wardrobe. One size down and one the regular size your little one wears.Ive never been a good student, so please excuse my poor writing. *thumbs up* Je connaissais dÃ©jÃ\\xa0 la marque en aillant achetÃ© les premiÃ¨res pour ma fille en 2019. Elle en a voulu cette annÃ©e 2021 c\\'est le prix qui m\\'a fait reculÃ© !... Je les avais achetÃ© 22â\\x82¬ en 2019 et maintenant les moins chÃ¨re sont Ã\\xa0 40â\\x82¬... Et les modÃ¨les sont pas terrible... Ses prÃ©fÃ©rÃ©es Ã©taient Ã\\xa0 65, 85â\\x82¬. ð\\x9f\\x98±ð\\x9f\\x98± Pour des petits pieds qui changent de taille tous les 6 mois mon dieu.......Pour au final la peinture s\\'enlÃ¨ve Ã\\xa0 certains endroit au bout de quelques sorties... Qu\\'on perd aussi quelques strass... Non c\\'est pas sÃ©rieux... OK elles sont super canon mais elles ont pas une qualitÃ© comme les grandes marques... Je suis tellement dÃ©Ã§ue !.....C\\'est possible de les laver Ã\\xa0 30 degrÃ©s je lai toujours fait avec ses ancienne et aucun problÃ¨me pour les lumiÃ¨res Ã§a clignotent toujours. Belles chaussures pour des petites filles: paillettes, lumiÃ¨res, colorÃ©es elles sont fan. Seulement attention, dans d\\'autres marque ma fille porte du 27 et lÃ\\xa0 je peux bien ajouter 1doigt voir 2 derriÃ¨re son talon. Elles les aiment tellementqu\\'on les garde pour l\\'annÃ©e prochaine et optons pour d\\'autres motifs en 26 (il y a du choix!). E piaciuto molto Au top, comme toujours avec cette marque !Chassures solides, bien finies, originales. It fits to size, easy to slip on. If you have a high arch you may have an issue slipping them on Loving these shoes! Some have mentioned them being hard to get on but I had no problem. No shoe horn needed. I bought the black Hawaiian print. Ordered my usual size and fit perfectly. Nice cushion inside but of wearing for a lot of walking you definitely want to wear some kind of ankle socks as they rub a bit on the pinkie toe after awhile.  I wore them at a festival for about six hours. No blisters...no pain...just a little rubbing on top of pinkie toe after a few hours. Easy to clean... tossed in wash on cold and air dried... perfect ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8cð\\x9f\\x98\\x8e These run small, Iâ\\x80\\x99m usually an 8-8.5, so I ordered 8.5, they are way too small. So order up at least 1 size, I gave them to my daughter who is a size 6. They are cute though. Mein Sohn liebt diese Schuhe! Fallen kleiner aus. Va bene Scarpa morbidissima.Comprata per utilizzare a lavoro, molto comoda Toller, leichter Schuh Las zapatillas son muy bonitas, como en la foto. Las he tenido que devolver porque tengo los pies anchos y las notaba justas. El largo perfecto. Passen sehr gut richtig guter Tragekomfort. Sehr guter Preis. Gern immer wieder. ARA Schuhe haben etwas besonderes, ich liebe diese Marke. Danke! Schuhe  GroÃ\\x9fe 38 Toller Schuh, sehr bequem! Ich habe 5 Paar Halbschuhe von Berkemann - alle in derselben GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe und Passform.Dieser Sneaker ist sehr leicht und ideal fÃ¼r den Sommer aber er ist Ã¼ber eine Daumenbreite lÃ¤nger (nicht breiter) als die vergleichbaren Halbschuhe in identischer GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe. Daher leider zurÃ¼ck. Scarpe comode e belle, le consiglio davvero Un buen producto con una buena oferta Really adorable,although wide.Im a size 6 regular and always a size 6.These are like a 6 1/2 wide so my feet slid out walking.I crochet a smaller insert and glued it in the front because the inside is furry and slippery but they are literally that cute so I had to keep them!I almost sent them back but 6 is the smallest size.That being said,I do love them for all their troubleð\\x9f\\x99\\x82ð\\x9f\\x92\\x95 Super cute shoe. I have really high arches and don\\'t know how comfy these will be to walk in, but I like the look. Why no instructions on how to clean, though? These are not very comfortable to wear very long - they hurt the tops of my feet. I get a lot of compliments when I wear them Super I\\'ve now purchased 3 pairs of these. They are the most comfortable walking shoes I have found, by far (and I walk about 15-20 miles per day on a treadmill desk). THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU SHOULD KNOW - there are two versions being sold here. One version is \"Made in the USA\", and the other version is made elsewhere. You can easily tell which version you are looking at because the US version says \"Made in the USA\" on both the tung and side of the shoe. The non-USA version is more comfortable, but less durable. Also the USA version runs about 1 size small. I enjoy wearing both about equally. The US version is better for running, the international version is more suited for walking. See pix. I absolutely love the look of this shoe and the fact socks donâ\\x80\\x99t need to be worn with them. I returned the normal size I always get since they felt way too big. Went down half a size and they were fairly tight. I stuck with the smaller size since I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to wear socks with them and the hope theyâ\\x80\\x99d break in just a little (they have just a bit). This shoe runs slightly narrow in the toe box and no support for running which I assumed before buying. They arenâ\\x80\\x99t as â\\x80\\x9cbreathable I thought they would be as well. The biggest issue Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had is even just walking my dog in them the insoles constantly would move. Iâ\\x80\\x99d have to take off my shoe and adjust it multiple times in just a few miles (I had to glue them down). I really love the look, but if youâ\\x80\\x99re actually moving in them they donâ\\x80\\x99t perform. I prefer Nike flyknit free run shoes if you want sockless shoes you can actually walk in. These things looked really comfortable. I got about what I expected, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.the uppers are all an elastic material Nothing hard even above the heel. You slip them on like a slipper. the laces do nothing and are just for show. Elastic pulls your feet tight against the sole. So it is essentially like a slipper with a shoe sole. Unfortunately, that make them kind of hot. It is a little hard to get the shoe on without getting a wrinkle in your sock and that will make your feet hurt after a little while. The thing I like least about the shoe is that it feels and sounds like you are walking in galoshes. they flap a little when you walk.They are not terrible and they look good. I will wear them until they wear out, but I will not buy another pair. I\\'ve never owned a pair of shoes quite like these before, so maybe it\\'s on me for not going in with the right expectations, but I fine that these shoes are not suitable to be your everyday shoe. The woven \"sock like\" nature is comfortable for short periods but after a few months of wearing them every day, I\\'ve found that the lack of support they give your feet actually leaves them feeling more sore than a normal shoe, and my knees have started hurting. I think these would be great for times when you\\'re not in them for very long, but I wouldn\\'t recommend them if you\\'re looking for a shoe to wear for 10hours a day I have one word to say wow. I am a huge New balance fan and I love their shoes for years. I thought it would give this style a chance and man am I happy. They are so comfortable so soft. I just can\\'t say enough good things about them. So I\\'m stocked up for the future I bought another five pairs. reason about so many sometimes on Amazon or other places you buy shoe and you love it and then five months or six months later down the road you want to buy that same pair and you can\\'t find it. So what I\\'ve been doing the past year so is just buying multiple pairs so I don\\'t run out. They\\'re extremely sharp looking with jeans and shorts. They look sharp for casual and work.I am so pleased with these shoes these got to buy far be the best new balance in the most comfortable and extremely good-looking shoe. When you first put them on you\\'re like wow I said these are amazing and they are get them and you won\\'t be disappointed. Just a smidge too big but may be doable w socks. It sucks cause I wanted to go sockless w these. I\\'m going to consider keeping them for the look and price. Dang... I\\'m already returning my other NB I just ordered from here same issue. Cool shoes but you may want to go 1 1/2 down if you have a more narrow foot. Update: Returning them. They are big and provide no protection for the toesies. All I feel is my big toe nail poking thru the shoe. I\\'ll be better off wearing house shoes to the gym. Shoes feel great as expected from the fresh foam technology. First shoe I have had with truly sock fit structure so take a little getting used to. If your feet are a bit smaller or donâ\\x80\\x99t fill out the structure  they will lose some of that tightening them up with the laces but feels good and if you like a looser less structured shoe they are great! Look great and very stylish IMO. These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet. Itâ\\x80\\x99s unbelievable. You feel like you donâ\\x80\\x99t have on shoes but little clouds. So far so good, I have put just over 20 road miles on these shoes in the first three days and the shoes are comfortable, plush, and forming to my feet. The shoes seem durable but I donâ\\x80\\x99t know yet. With such a soft sock like upper, I was concerned they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have support but they do. The upper is really comfortable.One small negative, the front tongue is high and started to uncomfortably rub the front of my ankles but easily solved by folding the tongue over (stayed folded on a 7 miler) or with taller socks. Super cute.  Warm.  Fit like Skechers runners. True to size.Cat approved! Para mÃ\\xad gusto son pesados I have to wear more shoes with ankle support and these do really good I had thought they would be way heavy on me feet but no they feel good they have enough room for your tooties to say oh wow I can relax out finally so yes I give these awesome shoe boots a 5***** thank you sketchers and thank you Amazon God\\'s Blessing to all Stay Safe .... Love these sneakers! They fit perfectly and have received many compliments!  So comfortable and warm - I have leather boots I can no longer wear because they are too heavy for me to walk in so these are perfect! (I use a walker is why leather boots are too heavy for me.) You will love them! I would say can\\'t wait for winter to wear em\\', but NAH! I enjoy the summer. But I will say that are comfy inside, flexible sole and seem warm. I\\'m happy I purchased them. To me they are true to size as well. Super cute and are comfortable very cozy. lots of complements Bei diesen Schuhen ist schon beim ersten Tragen der Stoff vorne an der Schuhspitze am Ã\\x9cbergang zur Sohle gerissen, nach zweimal weiterem Tragen auch an anderen Stellen.Mein Sohn  hat sich einfach nur normal damit fortbewegt !DafÃ¼r das es Markenschuhe sind sehr Ã¤rgerlich.Sind dies Ã¼berhaupt Originalschuhe?Kann ich mir nicht vorstellen. Optisch ein sehr schÃ¶ner Kinderschuh. Tochter hat sehr schmalen FuÃ\\x9f und trotzdem ist der Schuh bei den GummibÃ¤ndern sehr eng. Stoff ist vorne beim 5ten Mal tragen (Freizeitschuh/kein Gartenschuh) gerissen. Sehr schade. Wir haben die Schuhe in vielen GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen und verschiedene Farben und sindsehr zufrieden. Dem Kind gefallen sie und er kann super damit laufen. Schlechte QualitÃ¤t, hatte schon nach einer Woche vorne ein Loch im Stoff. Jetzt nach einem Sommer ist die Sohle schon sehr abgelaufen und eigentlich kÃ¶nnen sie direkt in den MÃ¼ll. Ich hatte von Puma eigentlich mehr erwartet Zapatilla de niÃ±a muy bonita pero la tela del frente es fina y no se su resistencia... Delicada para niÃ±as de 3-4 aÃ±os. Mein Sohn trÃ¤gt sehr gerne Puma Sportschuhe in verschiedenen AusfÃ¼hrungen seit Jahren. Diese Sportschuhe sind leider mit Abstand die Schuhe, die nur nach 2mal tragen ein Loch an der Spitze hatten. Ich denke ein Schuh in dieser Preiskategorie sollte schon bisschen lÃ¤nger halten.Die 2 Sterne gibt es fÃ¼r\\'s Aussehen und die ElastizitÃ¤t. Sono arrivati in anticipo, giÃ\\xa0 li porta mio figlio da un poâ\\x80\\x99 di giorni sembra un buon prodotto Tolle sehr leichte Schuhe die gut gedÃ¤mpft sind. Ã\\x9cber die Haltbarkeit kann ich noch nicht viel sagen. Auf jeden Fall wirkt dieses Produkt sehr wertig und unserem 4 jÃ¤hrigen haben sie auf Anhieb sehr gefallen. Bonitas y cÃ³modas,  buena calidad. SchÃ¶n und schicker Schuh Eigentlich mag ich Socken von nur die. Aber diese sind nichts. Ultra dÃ¼nn mit noch dÃ¼nneren Stellen, die einem dann als BelÃ¼ftung verkauft werden. Ich halte es eher fÃ¼r eine Sollbruchstelle. Auch sind die Socken sehr rutschig. Man rutscht im Schuh, der bei mehreren anderen Marken Socken gut sitzt, wie verrÃ¼ckt herum. Nervig. Gut dass ich nur ein Paar zum probieren bestellt habe. I like Nur Die socks because they are made of bambus which make them super airy. Perfect for summer! They are indeed little bit smaller if you consider sizes and there is no big dofference between sizes 35-38 and 39-42 but I would say if you are up to size 37 order smaller one and if you are 38-40 order bigger one. Over 40 it won\\'t fit well. Obwohl die Socken super dÃ¼nn sind, sind sie sehr saugfÃ¤hig und luftdurchlÃ¤ssig. Perfekt fÃ¼r den Sommer. Die Socken sind unglaublich weich und angenehm zu tragen. Halten auch nach vielen WÃ¤schen ihre Form. Ein Stern Abzug weil jedes Paar in einer PlastiktÃ¼te verpackt war. Das ist nun wirklich absolut unnÃ¶tig und nicht mehr zeitgemÃ¤Ã\\x9f. Sonst hÃ¤tte ich 5 Sterne gegeben. sehr angenehmes, weiches Material. Man bekommt keine SchwitzfÃ¼Ã\\x9fe, perfekt im Sommer. Bought these shoes for my great niece. They fit well and are comfortable. She absolutely loves them. She\\'s a picky little princess, so it\\'s always a gamble getting her clothing or shoes. These shoes, however, she really loves. My daughter lives these shoes. She jumps in them and loves the lights. Too bad they only light up on one side. They appear lightweight and therefore comfortable. Happy with my purchase. We got these as a cheap daycare shoe but they are amazing quality. I expected the little â\\x80\\x9cdiamondsâ\\x80\\x9d to fall off easily or the lights to stop working (sheâ\\x80\\x99s rough on shoes at daycare) but they are all still in tact & lights still work perfectly. I think we will get a lot of life out of these & I will absolutely buy the next size up when itâ\\x80\\x99s time! My daughter loves her light up shoes. They\\'re definitely light weight and so far they haven\\'t come apart. If they continue to hold up, they were definitely worth every penny paid! The bottoms are slippery which was disappointing.  My little kiddo kept slipping with them on. These were for my granddaughter who loves them! Though my daughter loved these but was disappointed that it doesn\\'t light up in one shoe.. I will have to return these. Easy on, easy off, very comfortable. Comfy to kid feet I bought these for my son to grow into but my daughter liked them so much she wanted them for herself. These are so very cute and I would say unisex because of the preppy tennis shoe look. My daughter likes to pair them with denim and something pink and it\\'s a great combo of tomboy and girly-girl. The material is thick, the sole is sturdy, and the stitching is clean. Very good quality shoe at an excellent price. I am ordering another pair for my son! Fit as expected, but my son has worn them 3 times and the inside is coming up already. I was able to glue it back down but kinda sucks to have to do that to a brand new pair of shoes. Son loves them my boy loves them. they fit perfectly. No additional comments Fine Me quedo perfectamente muy bien era lo que esperaba Los zapatos de excelente calidad, recomendados al 100%, lo malo fue que le quedaron grandes a mi novio, era un regalo, es su nÃºmero 29, pero Le quedaron grande. Traten de pedir una talla menos, por ejemplo mi novio es 29, un 28.5 Le hubiera quedado mejor! Suerte! Me gusto mucho  justo como esperaba Calidad genial, excelente EstÃ¡n sÃºper padrÃ\\xadsimos y muy cÃ³modos. Muy comodos me encanto Todo perfecto They look good and ok material quality. If you want to wear them for sitting at your desk they are fine but they provide zero support and although fitting snug, the material is so weak that your feet are flying left and right. Itâ\\x80\\x99s feeling dangerous at many points. I twisted my ankle first time running with them when making a change in direction. I find them dangerous and wonâ\\x80\\x99t wear them for work out. So I\\'ve never spwnt more then 25.00 on a pair of shoes and ive always just bought shoes from walmart i can honestly say thisbwas worth the money and i will never by a pair of shoes from walmart The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0Ho acquistato queste scarpe per il mio bimbo. La qualitÃ\\xa0 Ã¨ Geox: scarpe robuste, leggere, traspiranti e prodotte con materiali di qualitÃ\\xa0. Il piede non suda e le chiusure con il velcro tengono e sono solide. La suola Ã¨ flessibileÂ\\xa0e ti rendi conto immediatamente che Ã¨ comoda e di pelle! Anche dopo aver indossato le scarpe per qualche ora, non ho notato segni rossi sui piedini.Il design Ã¨ prettamente sportivo,carino e si presta ad un uso quotidiano. Il colore Ã¨ strepitoso, blu e rosso...a mio avviso sono piÃ¹ belle viste dal vivo!!!E poi vogliamo parlare delle luci LED? Il mio bimbo quando le ha viste Ã¨ impazzito di gioia e ora vuole mettere solo queste scarpe! Comodissimo il tasto on/off per le occasioni piÃ¹ \"sobrie\".Sono molto carine indossate con jeans e felpa, ma anche con dei piÃ¹ pratici joggers. Peraltro le ho prese in promozione e quindi le ho pagate poco rispetto ai prezzi esposti nei negozi monomarca.La taglia corrisponde a quella delle scarpe abituali del bimbo.Consigliatissime per tutte quelle occasioni in cui occorre praticitÃ\\xa0.Ottimo anche il rapporto qualitÃ\\xa0 prezzo.5 stelle meritate e riacquisto futuro delle Geox garantito!Dai un\\'occhiata alle foto e al breve video che allego cosÃ¬ da farti meglio un\\'idea sul prodotto.Spero di esserti stata d\\'aiuto nella tua scelta e se cosÃ¬ fosse, fammelo sapere ð\\x9f\\x91\\x87! Piaciute moltissimo per la forma e il colore, speriamo durino anche nel tempo TUTTO OK era come  descritto An der Schuhspitze lÃ¶st sich bereits die Schuhnaht, Schuh ist gerade mal 2.5 Monate alt, ansonsten wÃ¤re es ein toller Freizeitschuh gewesen. Chaussures au top . Confortables et lumiÃ¨res clignotantes au moindre pas dÃ¨s que l\\'on actionne cette option en appuyant sur le bouton.Bien toutes les saisons mais Ã\\xa0 voir pour l\\'hiver... Passt haargenau und ist hervorragend beim Gehen und Laufen.Macht den FÃ¼ssen nicht weh.Optimaler Schuh Produit bien adaptÃ©. Jamais dÃ©Ã§ue avec ces geox lÃ\\xa0. De plus elles sont lumineuses. L\\'avantage c\\'est qu\\'on peut Ã©teindre les lumiÃ¨res car bouton marche/arrÃªt sur le cÃ´tÃ© de la chaussure. Pour les enfants transpirant beaucoup des pieds les geox sont gÃ©niales et cette semelle est, de mon point de vue, plus rÃ©sistante que les autres. Bien pour l Ã©tÃ© car respirante mais pas trÃ¨s solide notamment sur le devant qui se dÃ©colle Super comodissime. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve owned at least 15 pair of Allen Edmonds shoes over the years, so I was particularly disappointed with these. The fit with my usual size (11.5 EEE) was uncomfortably tight (length and width) and the leather seemed thin and far from what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come to expect. I returned them immediately. Nice quality AE shoes. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not made in the US, but I knew that when I bought them. They look very good. Very good, I\\'m using them in mowing a steep hill and they do a plenty good job of giving me the necessary grip. They look fantastic and seem to be made out of excellent materials.I have 2 issues with these:First, the wide width size is not quite wide... They feel standard width and that is thought on my feet and makes them a little uncomfortable to wear for a very prolonged period.Second, the heel is a bit low and very stiff, so at one point it slid off and back on just a little and cut my heel pretty bad.If you are fine with the low tops or use thick socks, and if you don\\'t have especially wide feet, I highly recommend these shoes. New Balanxe is the best bar none. My sons a high school pitcher. We bought Nikeâ\\x80\\x99s and realized his mechanics were off. Turned out his ankles were rolling in on the Nikeâ\\x80\\x99s (heâ\\x80\\x99s got flat feet). So we went back to tried and trie NB. For perfect, excellent support all around, and the only baseball clear that does a true wide. Double bonus: they like so cool and the price point was insane. 1/3 the price of the Nikeâ\\x80\\x99s. Highly Recomended. My son loves these! He said they are comfortable to run in and fits perfect! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a little tighter than expected Iâ\\x80\\x99d go a half size up Goof shoe.. very comfortable These flats are really comfortable for my wide feet. I ordered a regular 9.5 since the wide wasn\\'t available. These don\\'t squish my toes unlike other shoes. I can wear it with thick socks. I would have tried 9W but it wasn\\'t available and the 9.5 works well as the toe box is wide. Daughter is 12 years old and decide to try tap. Bought these for reason of cost and uncertainties of her likening tap. These shoes have held up extremely well to much abuse, from tap, shoes remain looking like new. They fit her feet well. She has zero complaints. The shoes are great. Deep enough for my inserts.  The Velcro closure is very easy to put on or take off. I am wearing them constantly,Being elderly, they will make a difference, as I had a fall recently.MOui Are you kidding me? I wear a 9, but I ordered a 10 and they are still 2 sizes too small. There is actually a \"41\" sticker on the bottom. I\\'d say that the 10 is equivalent to a size 7. Los compre para un adulto mayor, no resbalan, son comodos y suaves I normally wear a size 7 womens.  I ordered size 7 1/2.  The shoes arrived with stickers on the soles stating that they are size \"38\".  Size 38 in Europe is the equivalent of a size 8 here, so they should have been large for me.  Instead, they are so small I cannot even squeeze my feet into them. I will be returning them tomorrow. Son sÃºper cÃ³modos y fÃ¡ciles de limpiar sÃ³lo que vienen un poco grandes. I normally wear a 9.5 but ordered a 10. These were so small there was no way my foot would even come close to squeezing in. very comfortable  - soft letter!!  will buy other pair later!! Really nice Es ist bereits mein zweites Paar Kong Derbys. Das erste war aus Glattleder, und leider ist diese an der Spitze nicht sehr haltbar und auch bein normaler Nutzung sahen die frÃ¼h schÃ¤bbig aus.Das Problem hat diese Variante nicht, sie sehen trotzdem gut aus und nicht Ã¼bertrieben nach Wanderschuhen oder so.Nur an den Sohlen dÃ¼rfte Think! noch nachbessern. Ich sag nur: Schotterparkplatz. FÃ¼r mich mÃ¼sste Think! zu diesen Schuhen eine Hufkratzer dazulegen. I needed shoes that were comfortable, had arch support, fit my difficult feet, and looked nice and professional for work. I\\'m young and a lot of shoes that fit the bill aren\\'t cute, but these look good and as a bonus they work great with socks (especially fun ones that poke through the cut outs.) I walk several miles a day in them, and they were comfortable from day one. I find myself reaching for them everyday when picking out what to wear. This is the first pair of shoes I\\'ve found that I can\\'t find a single complaint with- I\\'ve already picked out the next pair of Propet shoes I\\'m going to buy. My Granddaughter loves them. Ich liebe diese Schuhe. Sie schmiegen sich an den Fuss an und laufen wie von selbst. Gewohnt hervorragend gearbeitet und aus den besten Materialien. Da lohnt sich jeder Cent den man dafÃ¼r ausgegeben hat. Dazu langlebig, keine Wegwerfware sondern haltbar ohne Ende. Ich habe schon seit 10 Jahren ein Paar das immer noch nicht ausgetreten ist obwohl ich sie regelmÃ¤Ã\\x9fig trage. Also auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert. These Propet shoes are comfortable. I ordered a 10 narrow.  I normally wear a 10 but measure a AAA rather than a AA so I knew these shoes might be a bit wide. They fit well with heavier socks. I can add an insole and wear them with tights or light socks. They do not have as thick cushioning or as much arch support as SAS Roamers but for one third the price they are good and comfortable shoes. They do not have a deep toe box. That doesn\\'t bother me but it might be an issue for some. Sizes are a little small. My daughter just started fitting in size 1 and the size one was too small Ich wollte einen nachhaltigen Schuh kaufen. Ob Think wirklich nachhaltig ist, also in Arbeitsbedingungen, Materialien sowie Herstellungsverfahren kann ich nicht definitiv sagen. Der Schuh ist schÃ¶n, nach einem Tag Einlaufzeit sitzt er top. Wie es mit der Langlebigkeit ist, werde ich sehen. Derzeit top Purchased for my mother, who needs good support.  She has the other style propetâ\\x80\\x99, Mary Jane, and really likes them.  Took a chance on a slightly different style and she loves them.  They fit true to size, stay on with no heel slipping, good traction on bare floors.  The shoe does not rub or cut the foot as some new shoes may.  Very comfortable from the start.  Definitely recommend! They irritate my daughters back ankle a little but are otherwise wonderful. Vor Ã¼ber 20 Jahren habe ich meinen ersten Think! gekauft und dann immer mal wieder. Noch heute ist er qualitativ sehr gut und das Design ist klasse. Ich bin jedenfalls begeistert. Love my Propet shoes! I recently purchased this style for fall/winter.The material is a suede-like brushed leather upper. Soft and pretty in black.The insole is very cushiony!I wore them to the grocery yesterday just to try them out. They are much too snug across the top of my feet.  When I took them off my feet were swollen.  I\\'m keeping them in hopes they will stretch out a bit.8w Perfect tap shoes, daughter loved the clasp, easy to take on and off Super bequem. Ich trage die nur noch. In anderen Schuhen fÃ¼hle ich mich eingeengt. I have bought the biggest size available and it just about fits my son.. I would have loved to buy one size bigger. These kind of sandals are not found so often. I would have loved if they made these sandals for all foot sizes These shoes are very comfortable. I am a greeter at church and they are super comfortable. I have Neuropathy, Fibromyalgia and Arthritis, so I need good and comfortable shoes. Not great for kids with wide feet Passt einfach ohne vorher anprobiert zu haben. Perfekt verarbeitet. Mi hijo es 20.5 y pedi 21 , le quedo muy comodo. Vienen amplios del dorso,. Solo me enviaron color gris y pedi color el verde Meine GroÃ\\x9f ist normalweise 46 , aber es ist klein mit diese Shuhe.MÃ¶chte gerne 46,5 .Was soll ich machen ? My son likes the bright color. Its comfortable and light weight. GUte QualitÃ¤t Superbe paire de chaussures.. exactement le model en photo... magnifique !!! Damaged products received 2 times... disappointed with quality of Skechers... First time quality related issue in Skechers super Schuh,weiches Leder und passt genau! AchetÃ©es pour mon fils, pour remplacer ses prÃ©cÃ©dentes chaussures. Je ne suis pas un grand fan des achats de vÃªtements sur internet, mais lÃ\\xa0, c\\'est impeccable et la qualitÃ© REDSKINS. Me encantaron y a mi niÃ±a mas !!!! EstÃ¡n hermosos King kong ist super Chaussures portÃ©es une 20aine de fois, les semelles se dÃ©collent... Les coutures donnent des signes de faiblesse!Passez votre chemin! Love the shoes TrÃ¨s belles chaussures These are terrible. I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe theyâ\\x80\\x99re actually Skechers. I have worn many Skechers shoes of different types over the years, and have bought many different kinds for my girls. These are the first pair Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever felt that have super uncomfortable interiors. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re water shoes, so theyâ\\x80\\x99re meant to be worn without socks, yet the inside seam where the fabric backing is stitched to the main part of the shoe is so scratchy! My girls each tried on a pair and both were exactly the same inside, so I am returning both. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll be going with Speedo brand water shoes this year. These shoes were really cute on, and the neoprene back made them easier to get on and off than the classic style. I thought it would make it comfortable as well, however the neoprene is sewn into the shoe with a rather large sharp seam at the ankle. I ordered these for 2 children and both complained of the sharpness and had red marks within 2 minute of walking around the house. Sad because they were great in theory. The shoes are nice, but they don\\'t have the proper size chart loaded on this Amazon page.  These \"little kids\" shoes say age 4-8. My soon to be 4 years old son wears a size 9 toddler shoe, so I thought since the size 6 was on sale, I would get it for him to grow into later.  Turns out its the same as a toddler size 6 shoe. Why don\\'t they say age 0-4 toddler then?  And the big kid size must really be for little kids 4-8?Shoes are great, just need a better description and size chart.  Hope this helps any other mom wondering the same :) I so wanted to love these. First off they are so pretty. The gold and pale pink combo looked great in person. I wanted a shoe my little one could slip on without assistance from me or having to sit down to put them on. Unfortunately these were not it. The neoprene back has almost no give so to put  on required sitting down and even then she struggled to get these on herself. I told her she could also wear them as a slip on and step on the neoprene backing but she complained that it felt uncomfortable under her foot. That was a feature I thought she would love to get out the door even quicker but again this was not the case. If the backing had more stretch it could be the perfect slip on water friendly shoe.  We\\'ll be sticking to Natives and Crocs for our go to summer shoes. I was so bummed these didn\\'t work out for us. Sie sind anders,  als abgebildet. Vorne nur Stoff! Shoe packaging is nice the shoe looks just as pictured if not better. The only con is i hste shoes that have shoe laces more for decorations then actual shoe lace needs. This shoe has just that shoe laces that serve no purpose really. They are like slide in sneakers. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a huge fan of this brand. The shoes always fit and never leave blisters. Great quality! Super cute. My daughter loves them. They fit pretty true to size. My daughter loved them. I bought a .5 size bigger she said they fit awesome. Thumbs up. Cute and comfortable. So far so good fit so good and  the color is great fits comfty First pair of theses but i like them The product is not sold as advertise. It is too hard on the foot and feels more plastic then rubber I like them Love these flip flops! I owned a pair similar to these and they were just worn out, so I took a chance and ordered some from Amazon. I was very pleased that they fit as expected and are very comfortable! There is substantial support for a flip flop with good wide straps that are desired A little squeaky at first and takes a few days to wear that squeak out as the foot molds the foam. Hubby loves the comfort and style, and I love the price! Wore them for my beach wedding. Comfortable and fit well. I am going to buy another pair. My husband loves these. This is the first time I have been able to get him to not always wear his tennis shoes. Slip on and go. So perfect for him... and he loves the look. These seemed like very nice flip flops. Sadly, I am a 13 shoe and the 12/13 are a little too small for me. Some people would consider this a \"tight fit\" but to me it is very comfortable and secure. I purchased 2 more pairs after I received my first ones in the mail. Nice, attractive flip flops but the size 12/13 does not fit my husband\\'s size 13 foot. Meine FuÃ\\x9flÃ¤nge betrÃ¤gt 27cm und ich habe 42,5 bestellt. Nunja.. wenn man breitere FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe hat wÃ¼rde ich zur 43 greifen und werde auch diese nachbestellen. Die Verarbeitung ist super und die Schuhe sind leicht. Ich habe auf anderen Seiten gelesen das diese groÃ\\x9f ausfallen sollen und habe leider dementsprechen eine halbe Nummer kleiner bestellt. Yo pedi talla 20 mx y llego una totalmente diferente, es mas el producto que se ve en la imagen tiene agujeta y el que a mi me llego trae velcro Excelente me apoye en la tabla de tamaÃ±os de Amazon y quedaron mÃ¡s que bien.! El diseÃ±o y la calidad de New Balance.Son cÃ³modos fÃ¡ciles de poner y quitar. Los tenis esta muy chicos yo quiero cambiar los tenis querÃ\\xada un nÃºmero 21 de MÃ©xico y segÃºn yo decÃ\\xada asÃ\\xad en los que peci La caja llegÃ³ muy daÃ±ada. Excelente le gustaron mucho a mi hija I got these after reading up on the best shoes for toddlers with pronation. My toddler loves them and his ankles and arches look more supported in these than in the majority of his other shoes. They are a little more expensive than the typical stride rite shoes that I have gotten in the past but these have a lot of support and seem to be plenty comfortable for my active toddler. I chose these shoes specifically because I wanted laced shoes for my toddler. A pair of laced shoes is shown in the photo; however, I received a pair of Velcro shoes in the same color/design. So perhaps, if you order a size 8W, like I did, you may end up with Velcro shoes, so just be prepared. Too small, had to return. It also doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look like very good craftsmanship inn the show itself. Shoes look good, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand why would you send Velcro when picture clearly shows laces! I canâ\\x80\\x99t be bothered to send them back especially since I know they wonâ\\x80\\x99t be replacing them with the correct shoes. I wish I had seen the other reviews. The rim of the heal area rubs at the back of the ankle. It is comfortable. Send it to my dad. He loves it. I like the color. Not comfortable at all. is ok J\\'ai d\\'abord achetÃ© ce produit en fonction des cm du pieds de ma 14,5 cm soit 26 de pointure sur le tableau, et j\\'ai du faire un Ã©change car les chaussons faisaient presque 20 cm de long !Ã\\x89changÃ©s donc avec une pointure 22 et les chaussons allaient parfaitement.Ils sont super jolies et douillets, seul bÃ©mol il manque une languette a l\\'arriÃ¨re pour faciliter l\\'enfilage (mon mari n\\'a jamais rÃ©ussi Ã\\xa0 les mettre sur ma fille). Je pense qu\\'avec un pied plus fort impossible a mettre. Lo non le ho piÃ¹ acquistate Die QualitÃ¤t ist nicht so gut TrÃ¨s belle lÃ©gÃ¨re taille bien rien a dire Excelente artÃ\\xadculo, solo el color no me terminÃ³ por agradar, de ahÃ\\xad en fuera todo estÃ¡ muy bien. EstÃ¡n muy bonitos y de buena calidad solo que me enviaron 6.5 en vez de 5.5 pero aÃºn asÃ\\xad se les darÃ¡ uso aquÃ\\xad Muy bien llego a tiempo la calidad muy bienn! Comodos ligeros excelente calidad *If your child has high arches and high bridge, go with the WIDE width instead of the Medium width. The elastic band under the shoe laces will be too small for a high bridge foot and cause discomfort. Go WIDE! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a beautiful light weight shoe and my 9yr old really enjoys they way they feel. He especially like the heel cup as it rides slightly high with a large tab that he can get a good hold of as he slips them on and off. We will be ordering more pairs in different colors. Perfect sneaker for active kids! They are lightweight and easy for my kids to put on. Not knowing how to tie, these laces stay tied longer (considering the rope type lace) and the boys can just slide them right one. The back is more of a rubber material which helps allow room for the heal to easily slide in.  Having two 5 year old twins, these shoes being simple to put on saves me time on busy school mornings.  They have worn them since March pretty much every day through a bike riding, hiking, the park and riding their scooters.  They hold up very well. I bought these in July for my daughter to start school in August of 2021. We love the shoes in general, we owned the gray last year with no problems. However, i bought the navy this year and they broke not even 3 weeks in. I fixed with a thread/needle. now fast forward to today 10.22.21. They broke again and are unraveling. I am not satisfied with how they are made. Other than that it is a good shoe, but the eyelets where the strings go through are not sturdy at all. I bought for a girl, so i can about imagine a boy may be even harder on the shoe. I ordered a big kids 6.5 which in most shoes fits perfect. These are a little big. So order true size. Other that that don\\'t not rip tag off of strings this will cause the lace loop to break. Pretty decent shoes Loved the fit and color of this sneaker.  However, less than a week out of the box and normal wear, the side of the shoe ripped.  Really surprised that that happened. Shoe lace eyelet broke, sent back and got another pair. Next day broke in same spot. Donâ\\x80\\x99t buy.  Then charges a $10.51 restocking fee!  Ridiculous!  Even after I tried to try a second pair. These are very comfy and cute sneakers.  My foot tends to be average to narrow width so if you have a wide foot, you might have a problem. I love the color! Looks like it costs twice the price. Naturalizer has always been a favorite of mine and this shoe is again a hit. Item not as described - not real leather, all man made which led to squeaking and sore heels. Very disappointed- too late to return. I needed these for physical therapy & Iâ\\x80\\x99m very satisfied. I usually wear a 7.5M & I bought a 7W & they are fine! Son muy lindos pero la calidad no es buena. Apenas tenÃ\\xadan dos dias de uso y se descosturo la lengÃ¼eta. cute, but not real leather Au dÃ©part assez dures comme toutes les dr. Martens, elles font un peu souffrir. Mais câ\\x80\\x99est aussi le gage de leur rÃ©sistance ....PrÃ©voir des grosses chaussettes et des pansements, au bout dâ\\x80\\x99une semaine elles sont adaptÃ©es Ã\\xa0 votre pied, ne font plus mal et vous durerons toute la vie! Very disappointed! It was advertised as leather, but this is a plastic shoe!The shape did not seem right either, I own several pairs of docs, and those just donâ\\x80\\x99t seem right. El calzado es bueno, la amortiguaciÃ³n boost se siente en plenitud, si tienes el pie amplio lo puedes sentir ajustado.  En mi caso en la parte de los dedos, sentÃ\\xad que la \"altura\" del tenis es un poco reducida y mi dedo gordo se asoma sobre el tejido.  No me agradaron los cojinetes de la zona del talÃ³n, no dan un soporte adecuado y en ocasiones sientes que el pie puede salir.  Rescato la amortiguaciÃ³n boost y el agarra sobre cualquier tipo de suelo. This is the first pair of Adidas basketball shoes i have owned and so far I am impressed. The boost soles add a noticeable amount of cushion and the toe shape is wide which is perfect for me feet. I often have a problem with my toes being too cramped in basketball shoes causing my toenails to break all the time. So far I haven\\'t had that problem with these. There is also pronounced cushion ridges in the lining at the heel which keeps your feet planted inside the shoe which is a must for balling in low tops. So far I am impressed, I just hope they hold up to wear and tear. These shoes are way wider than they look. Felt like I was wearing swim flippers. If you only wear these in doors you don\\'t have to worry, but if you wear them outside be prepared to pick up every single small pebble on the ground you ever step on. Despite being wide, they look was still cool and they fit a little tight. With my regular size. Do not wear these for indoor basketball. They slip and slide all over the place. Good for looks only, not function. To begin, I\\'ll say I don\\'t ever expect a running shoe in a basketball shoe, but I did expect an added layer of comfort with what appeared as a substantial amount of boost foam. In short, it\\'s still a quality shoe, but if you\\'re expecting ultra boost comfort, keep looking. It\\'s still a basketball shoe and it will still feel as such on your feet. This is a awesome good looking pair of shoes. The shoe fits as expected, and they are comfortable except that the tongue is to thin at the top and when i tighten my shoelaces they cause pain where the the tongue doesn\\'t protect right above the foot. I don\\'t have big feet by any measure but I found these shoes to be far too tight squishing my feet despite me ordering one size larger than my actual size. I tried wearing them once and they gave me such cramps I had to return them. These shoes were super tight when I first put them on, then after walking around inside for a few hours they loosened up and became very comfortable. I got these for dodgeball, but they just look too clumpy and big and it just wast my style and the look just wasn\\'t doing it for me. Cuando los desenpaque los senti algo pesados, pero ya puestos son bastantes livianos. PedÃ\\xad los de talla 12 pero recomendarÃ\\xada pedir un talla y media mÃ¡s, ya que los siento un poco apretados en lo ancho, de largo quedan perfectos Super bequem das Leder, drÃ¼ckt und schneidet nicht ein. Die Sohle ist super flexibel wie die Schuhe von pepino.  Meine Tochter hat einen hohen Spann und die passen supi. Ich habe die Sandalen in schwarz noch bestellt. Kann die Sandalen nur empfehlen. Ich hoffe ich konnte helfen. Tolles Material,tolle Verarbeitumg! pour la maison au bout d une semaine le talon s est completement use et fendu tres mauvais produit OMG, these deerskin moccasins are much nicer than I thought they would be. They are soft deerskin leather inside and out. No fake lining, no rubber sole, nothing but the real deal. Comfort beyond belief. These are for indoor use only; do not expect to wear them outdoors for even a few steps.As far as sizing, they are generously cut as far as the length goes. I typically buy size 11 or 12 shoes, depending upon the brand/style. I bought these in size 11. They fit perfectly even with socks on. So, if you are â\\x80\\x9con the fenceâ\\x80\\x9d about two different sizes, Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend going with the smaller of the two sizes that you typically buy in shoes. Purchased a pair of black double deer mocs several months ago. Aside from the top panels looking as though they were switched left to right the build quality seemed okay for a few months. Wife told me they were leaving black marks on the damp floor after she\\'d mop.  So I then purchased a pair of the \"natural\" double deer.  Wore those for a day and noticed a defect in the left insole, like a void in the padding between the two soles.  Sent in a request to Amazon for a replacement.  Returned those and received the replacement a few days later.  This pair has a weird anomaly with the insole of the right moc.  Kicking myself now for returning the first pair before the replacement arrived.  Between the two pairs I could have had one decent pair.  Giving up at this point, will wear them until they fall apart and just pretend that I\\'m not bothered by the feel of the right one.  Guess my expectations are just too high for a pair of $100 mocs.  I\\'ve had Minnetonka mocs most of my adult life and I don\\'t remember ever experiencing these kinds of problems in the past. I\\'m wearing them as I type. I mean I\\'m NOT typing with moccasin glad tootsies cause that would be silly... and I might pull a hammy. I was given a pair of Minnetonka mocs... many moons ago... and I wore them like forever and a 1/2. Fast forward through the memory archive and I now have another pair. On my feet. Real nice too. Size works for me and I like the little \\'sticky\\' patches you get while walking. You know what I mean. It\\'s those areas where it fits a little tighter and keeps these bad boys secure.Final thoughts where I don\\'t ramble... looks like good quality, stiching looks complete, a little padding in the bottom (something my EX might have said), light weight and no aardvarks were harmed in their production.CheeriooooOOOooooOoooooOOoo... I bought these for use inside my home. I love them and am thinking to buy an extra pair because you never know when they will stop making them! I got my brother a pair as well and he loves them too. I\\'m into high QUALITY SHOES OF ALL KINDS. I also have a pair of L.L. Bean lined (REAL shearling) with leather and unlined all leather, both are double sole slippers. I love those as well but these are much softer, due to the deer skin construction.These can be worn out side in DRY weather, summer time, used for driving, So you are from the house to car, Car to house. They are NOT for use walking outside all the time you will sear through the soles to quickly!If you want some beautifully made indoors shoes, that can be used in a limited way outside then these are for you. Real leather especially Deer Skin, is something you have to experience to understand and appreciate!You feet do not get nasty inside REAL leather shoes. They do not start to stink, unless you have nasty feet or problems to start with! I had a pair of the L.L. Beans for 30 years! They are VERY WELL MADE! So are these! Expensive, but of the highest quality. I ordered size 9 and returned them for 8 1/2. Which is still long enough that my toes don\\'t hit the end. I wear New Balance walking shoes in 8 1/2, 4E (the only company I know of that makes a shoe in that width). Amazingly, right out of the box these mocs were perfectly wide and had a very comfortable toe box.  I went through no stretching period at all. I must say I hesitated to pay, what, $80? Whatever. Now I wouldn\\'t send them back for twice what I paid. I have only worn them inside. If I don\\'t go out in them on concrete and asphalt, I figure I\\'ll still be wearing them for at least ten years, maybe twenty. (I\\'ve even worn them to bed to keep my feet a tad warmer.) I have been telling myself, for a good long time now, that $15 slippers from the superstore were good enough.I have been lying to myself, for too long now, and that lying was going to stop. Pronto.A good long time ago, I sold these moccasins. Simple, smooth, double deerskin soles.It wasn\\'t the simplicity of a cheap slipper that I have wanted. No. What I wanted was the simplicity of these quality Minnetonkas.The lies are over, and a little piece of me that was askew was renewed. What I wanted is what I got, and what I got is worth every penny.I wear a size 11.5 shoe. I bought a size 11 moccasin. You will have no real idea of how your moccasins are going to fit during the first 24 hours of wearing them. If you follow the simple rule of choosing a moccasin one-half size below your normal shoe size, you will be able to see how the leather and stitching are conforming to you foot during that first day\\'s use.If the moccasins are too tight, or too loose, then I have to ask you to reflect on the honesty with which you are reporting your shoe size. Please understand that there is nothing wrong with having size 13EEE feet. Please also understand, it is not Minnetonkas fault if you are trying to put that size 13EEE into a size 11 moccasin, and it doesn\\'t fit or even falls apart. It just isn\\'t.These moccasins have made me free.The leather is supple; the stitching is tight and a good complementary First size I ordered (as per reviews) was what I wear now. When the mocassins came in there was a nick in the leather. The mocassins were way too long. Do I returned for a replacement with the next smaller size. This set came in with one of rhe mocassins defective. Stitching was coming apart. And the mocassin was still too loose. They do feel comfortable to the naked foot. No arch support however. If you need arch support these are not for you, or (like I will, because I still like these) an arch support insert can be added. Hopefully this next time around they will fit.I am very grateful that they take CS seriously and are replacing these without charging me. I know that is expensive, but I ordered as per instructions on the site. Old-school deerskin moccasins just like I remember from years ago. Well-made, comfortable and I am guessing they will be very durable, though it\\'s too soon to tell for sure.  With a pair of cozy wool socks they are they perfect footwear for around-the-house fall and winter indoor wear.  The leather soles are thick enough for a quick trip out the mailbox or trash can so long as it is not wet outside. Note that they do run quite large. I ordinarily wear somewhere between a 9.5 and a 10.5 depending on the shoe (with the majority of shoes in my closet being a size 10) and I have a normal-width foot. The size 9 in these fits me quite well. Light weight, fit well. I normally wear a USA 9.5 and have a wide foot. Bets fit for shimano shoes seems to be a 44 for my wide feet. Muy bonitos y de buena calidad. Llegaron sÃºper rÃ¡pido. We received the incorrect size and sent them back to exchange for the correct size. I have sent several items back to Amazon and it has always been a smooth process. As for the shoes, I bought a pare for my 9 year old son who throws shot put and discuss. He has a very flat wide foot and they fit him perfectly without having to get a wide size. You want them to have a snug fit. Like most beginners he started throwing in heavy lugged running shoes and had a difficult time turning his hips. His PRâ\\x80\\x99s have gone up since buying the shoes because he can simply transfer power more effectively. So if you have a beginning thrower these ASICS will boost their throws and confidence. They are also affordable for a younger thrower that will eventually grow and need another pair at some point. ASICS quality is also on point. He has probably 1000 shot put throws and 1000 discus throws over the summer and hardly any wear on the shoe at all! A superior all-purpose throwing shoe for the price.  I only buy ASICS for throwing shoesdue to quality, comfort and durability.  My last pair of ASICS, similar to this pair, but higher end, lasted 7 years and I only retired them due to my shot putter borrowing them and breaking his own school record and placing fifth in the State of Florida 1A.  As is custom upon breaking a record, the shoes were retired after the State of Florida Championship. I am size 15 in the shoe fit perfectly Son likes Product ran very comparable to my sons shoe size. The shoe it self is as expected. The delivery was way faster than expected. It said expect shipping in a couple of weeks. It got to me in about 6 days. Very happy. Great throwing shoe. Great fit, very durable The shoe fits perfectly, it is a great starter throwing shoe, and definitely worth the money. These Throws shoes fit true to size. FÃ¤llt absolut grÃ¶Ã\\x9fengerecht aus. Sehr schÃ¶nes Leder und tolle Farbe. Super warm und absolut wasserdicht. Wir pflegen sie mit Bienenwachs. I know toddlers wear out shoes like crazy but the inner part of the shoe seems always humid and the leather looks terrible after a few weeks. Even with extra protection, the boots look bad. Very nice boots! Good quality and great comfort my daughter loves them and me too! Sehr schÃ¶ne und warme Stiefel. Passen aber nur bei dÃ¼nnen Waden. El producto que recibÃ\\xad son dos zapatos para el mismo pie. Pie derecho.TodavÃ\\xada tendrÃ© que realizar la devoluciÃ³n y pagar por eso. These are really nice sturdy shoes but definitely fit on the big side! Ordered a size 8 and got a size 9 fit Excelente producto FÃ¤llt etwas klein aus:bietet auf dem Hallenboden guten Halt Got these for my 12 year old after the Nikeâ\\x80\\x99s we got her made her slip too much!They have great grip and she said they were comfortable! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s normal between a 9.5-10 in show and I got her the 9.5 and they were perfect! I have other Adidas, size 8 1/2, I got the size 9 which I was expected to fit well but it is really tied. Some reviews suggested getting a smaller size; make me wonder if they are talking about the same shoes. They look great and I am hoping to break them in for better fit. My feet measure 9 1/4\" and size 6.5 fits perfectly. A bit stiff at first, but after one afternoon of wearing were perfectly comfortable. The shoe area at the top of ankle (top/rear of shoe) bothered me (dug into ankles) at first, but softened after first use, not a problem at all anymore. These shoes are designed for volleyball, but I use them to play tennis & they are great. Good fit, good traction, well produced. Very comfortable overall & I feel safe making swift moves on tennis court! i loved these shoes.my daughter plays volleyball and needed a supported shoe to wear.i would definately  consider these shoe to any volleyball mom. Runs small! VERY narrow across the heel and through the top of the foot. Also, super hard inside, the footbed is nice but everything else is really rigid. She said they were almost painful to stand in. My daughter loves these shoes and sheâ\\x80\\x99s a very picky shopper! They fit her great and she wears them proud! Good purchase! Currently owe 3 pairs of Toms in brown, blue and Black! Best all around casual to dressy menâ\\x80\\x99s shoes. It seemed like a quality product, but unfortunately it is not meant for those with wide or slightly chubby feet!  I should have realized this now that i think back to the original TOMS.  (I even bought a size bigger!) El producto lindo lo devolvÃ\\xad por tamano Per me non esistono altre scarpe da ginnastica , sarÃ² parziale , ma per me Ã¨  cosÃ¬...... ne ho un paio vecchissime ...incollatissime usatissime....le guardo e dico ogni volta: meravigliose! Modello originale e pianta del piede stretta perfetta per il mio piede! buone Regalo per la mia ragazza. Arrivato nei tempi previsti e in buone condizioni These are adorable. They almost seem to be a light denim fabric. My daughter hasn\\'t worn them yet - hoping for comfort. Do they have these in adult sizes??? Super trendy. excelente My son got a hole in the toe of his shoe after only a month of wearing. So disappointed in the quality. Bequemer Schuh, nur die Adidas Streifen lÃ¶sen sich nach paar mal tagen schon ab.Sehr sehr schadeâ\\x80¦. 300mmã\\x81®é\\x9d´ã\\x82\\x92è²·ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x80\\x81ã\\x81§ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x80\\x81295mmã\\x81®é\\x9d´ã\\x82\\x92å±\\x8aã\\x81\\x91ã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x9f The shoes are high quality but the sizing runs a bit small.

FÃ¼r den sehr gÃ¼nstigen Preis bekommt man hier einen bequemen und gut aussehenden Markenschuh. Demnach gibt es nichts auszusetzen Sehr schÃ¶ne Optik.Passt zu jeder Hosenfarbe. FÃ¼r diesen Preis 25â\\x82¬ mit prime Versand  finde ich okey QualitÃ¤t gut ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d They are sized accurately but keep in mind that your kid will be wearing thick soccer socks that can make their foot snug so you may want to go a half size up. Exactly what we wanted My son loves his red cleats. The are a bit narrow though. My new all-time fave shoes for lifting. I can really feel the difference in my connection with the ground. The first week I wore these, I PRd both my deadlift and my squat. Maybe just my mindset on those days but I do believe the shoes helped. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not only perfect for digging into the floor on heavy lifts, but theyâ\\x80\\x99re also super cute with shorts, jeans, leggings etc. I love em. I just absolutely love them. Wish I could find my size in some of the other colors because I would definitely add more of these to my â\\x80\\x9cshoe collection.â\\x80\\x9d  Some reviewers stated theyâ\\x80\\x99re like â\\x80\\x9cclown shoesâ\\x80\\x9d because of the wide toebox- I do not find that to be the case but I do prefer a roomier toebox. Love the low profile (I loath thick soled sneakers). The first few wears I did notice a tightness across the top of the foot where the seam is but my the third time I wore them, they were broken in and are now my â\\x80\\x9cclose toedâ\\x80\\x9d shoe of choice. I found the fit to be very true to size. Love the color. And LOVE that the laces stay tied throughout my entire workout! I usually wear a 6.5. The other reviews said they ran small so I ordered 2 sizes up. I ordered a 7.5. I could have used an 8. This is so far off that \"runs small\" doesn\\'t capture the issue. My toe is pressed to the end of the toe box and they are 2 sizes larger than \"normal\". I am glad I took other reviewers\\' advice to order half a size up.  Even so, it fits quite narrow but the room in the toe area is just perfect (not too much and not too little).  I wouldn\\'t order a whole size up though so half a size is good.  These will help dig those heels on the ground during squats and deadlifts.  I am a powerlifter and have been looking for these shoes for so long.  Glad I found them now.  I think these are more superior to Converse.  Again, the only reason why I am taking a star off is due to the narrow fitting but I guess that\\'s how the shoes will keep your feet from moving. I\\'m sure I would love this shoe, if it fit! I sized up 1/2 size like everyone suggested, and they are 1/2 size too large :(I am a true 8.5 in all brands, and it seems this shoe is no exception. If you feel you are solidly the same size across brands, I do not recommend sizing up.Also, only order prime! Because the non-prime-but-still-free-shipping company makes you pay for the return shipping and a 15% restocking fee. The fit is soooo narrow! I have a wider foot, but even if I didnâ\\x80\\x99t it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t fit because the seam by the toes fits right on the bone by your big toe and it is extremely painful to just put on. The quality looks good, but I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have a clue how they actually work because of the fit. Returned them Mom loves these shoes but they will take a little time to break in. They are so cute on! A bad experience, the shoe has only been worn for the second time, the sole has fallen off, and the shoe body is too hard! It is very cute , my daughter loves it . Def order 1/2 size larger . I like to order more in diff color Product is great, they run a little bit small, so I suggest ordering a half size larger. Love the sneakers. Been using this for two years and still grippy! The suede is a bit high in maintenance but the color is great. Light weight, great looking and perfect for casual work or play. Didn\\'t require any break in at all. Felt good right out of the box! The boots arrived just as I ordered them, on time and they are very pretty. love it.  And the price, excellent. Always bought Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s unstructured shoes for comfort. 40% cheaper than in store. Great value. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll enjoy them. Perfect fit and feel right out of the box.  Fit was consistent to size.  Very comfortable, soft sole.  Works well in the office or with more casual attire.  Ordered a second pair in a different color.  Very pleased with the quality and function. Stylish, comfortable, and quite versatile. Can\\'t go wrong with Clark\\'s. Si me quedÃ³ muy bien One of the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. Love these boots. nice boots but quite expensive Loved it Purple ones rock.  My kid gets compliments wherever we go. Loved them Produit de qualitÃ© trÃ¨s Moyenne. La semelle s\\'use plus rapidement  que d\\'autres souliers. J\\'avais eu en gros rabais et mÃªme lÃ\\xa0, je ne rachÃ¨terais pas Quedan un poco mÃ¡s grandes, estÃ¡n amplios y sÃºper cÃ³modos y ligeros Bought for my 10yr old son. They fit great. He has not complained. Had them a few months and they are still intact. My son loved the shoes, they were comfortable and fit well. The shoes laces are held in place by a piece of string and it broke a few days after we received them. I contacted Amazon right away and they instructed me to contact Adidas for a refund/exchange. I submitted my request to Adidas on July 11 as requested by Adidas customer service. When I didn\\'t hear anything after a few weeks I emailed them again. Several emails sent asking about an update went ignored. I had to use the chat feature on the Adidas website to get an answer. I was finally issued a return label and sent the shoes back and they were received on August 26. I followed up with customer service again and I was told I would receive an email update after 5 business days (the time it takes to inspect the item) and then the gift card would be issued within 7 business days. This still has yet to happen. When I contacted customer service again, they now changed their story and said that because I didn\\'t purchase the shoes directly from Adidas I would not receive my gift card until 20 business days after the shoes were received. I am now being told that I won\\'t receive my gift card until September 23, which is 2 1/2 months AFTER I submitted all of the required information to Adidas to start this process. I will not be making any more purchases of Adidas products. Bought these for my 10 year old. He likes the sleek look of adidas, but we won\\'t buy these again. Purchased mid-february and by early May, the soles were worn completely through in several places. I don\\'t mind spending more on name brand shoes because the quality usually matches the price, but that\\'s clearly not the case with these shoes. Very disappointed in the Adidas brand. We\\'ve had $15 sneakers from Walmart last longer than this. Waste of money. These are very comfortable shoes, but my son has gone through 3 pairs since April.  Of course he grows out of them quickly, so Iâ\\x80\\x99m replacing them anyway, but every pair has literally been falling apart after only a few months.  It would be nice if they could at least be used for play/yard shoes, but they arenâ\\x80\\x99t even in good enough shape for that.  We are going back to buying Nikes. Very nice presentation. The box was in amazing condition.(most of the time, they\\'re all torn apart and damaged) so bravo on that part ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8fSizing was good. My son is a 10/10.5 and these are 11. They fit him with room to grow. They look sharp! Definitely legit. They\\'re made in Indonesia. Usually, that\\'s a sign they\\'re authentic. Very good. One happy mama. I will update maybe in a few months to tell about the wear. My son has only worn these for six days and they are literally falling apart. He loves the fit and how light they are, but itâ\\x80\\x99s very disappointing that they look like this after less than a week. I needed some running shoes for my son quickly when he told me he signed up for track. Looked a some Nikes that were so soft, they\\'d shred in no time (as Nikes do), checked out some Under Armor...too clunky and heavy. Found these and they are pretty durable. They have a knitted top and light foam sole perfect for my kid. He\\'s rough on his stuff so these are perfect. These are pretty light for running or just play. I definitely recommend giving this pair a try. So glad I bought these. My son is the pickiest about his shoes. I let him pick these ones out after refusing the other ones I bought. They came 2 days earlier than expected and once they arrived I realized they donâ\\x80\\x99t have a tongue which is sweet. Itâ\\x80\\x99s easier for him to put on but looks and feels like a normal sneaker. I am very happy. Canâ\\x80\\x99t beat $30 for a name brand shoe that appeases my child â\\x98ºï¸\\x8f Comprei uma antes que ficou muito grande (29/30), precisei devolver para pedir um numero menor e ficou perfeita. Escolhemos a verde e achamos muito linda. Meu filho tem 5 anos e adorou. O produto nÃ£o foi entregue nas mÃ£os de alguÃ©m. Foi deixado no portÃ£o de casa ou jogado nÃ£o sei como. SÃ³ sei que os cachorros morderam e estraÃ§alharam o pacote e o chinelo. Muito chato!! Acho que a entrega deveria ser feita em mÃ£os, nÃ£o acham? Chinelo Ã© macio e me parece original , chegou antes do prazo e bem embalado . Comprei 33/34 para o meu filho que calÃ§a 32 de sapato fechado, e ficou perfeito . Ficou lindo no pÃ© do meu filho! Super recomendo. Gostei muito do prazo de entrega e o produto Ã© exatamente o que eu comprei e o que esperava do mesmo.Muito obrigada, Material da correia bem ruim! JÃ¡ arrebentou. Vai ter que ser como antes colocar preguinhos na correia para usar chinelo havainas por mais tempo. A forma Ã© muito grande. Comprei um nÃºmero acima do que meu filho estava usando, e estava pequeno, e ficou muito grande. Mas ele amou o chinelo e estÃ¡ usando assim mesmo. Entrega rÃ¡pida e produto muito bonito e de qualidade. Atende ao proposto no anÃºncio. Super indico. Chinelo bom, conforme esperado. Ã\\x93tima compra com valor acessÃ\\xadvel e entrega rÃ¡pida antes da data prevista. Produto igual do anÃºncio. Color, fit, everything great! Dieser Sneaker sieht wunderschÃ¶n aus... sehr bequem...einfach super toll SÃ¼per QualitÃ¤t..danke. Super basket Arrivate prima del previsto. Sono esteticamente molto belle. Le ho prese per la mia bambina di 11 anni. La taglia corrisponde perfettamente. Ora le proveremo nelle giornate di pioggia nel parco della scuola ma avendo giÃ\\xa0 ripetutamente acquistato scarpe Salomon, sono certa che si dimostreranno comode e impermeabili. El calzado es estupendo, de una calidad buenÃ\\xadsima, muy resistente, querÃ\\xada coger una talla mÃ¡s para q le quedara un poco grande pero le queda clavado, con lo cual es una talla bastante justa, pero en resumen estamos encantados con la compra!! Ottimo prodotto. Solido, impermeabile, calza bene. Passt genau und sieht gut aus. Salomon non smentisce mai Sehr leichter Schuh mit Schnellverschluss, die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe ist ein bisschen knapp bemessen. Son comodisimas, el tallaje estÃ¡ bien Prese al prezzo super di 12 euro. Le scarpe sono bellissime, piaceranno a qualsiasi bambino. I materiali sono ottimi, tomaia in similpelle molto morbida e facilissima da pulire con un colpo di spugna, suola dello giusto spessore e che si adatta benissimo al piede, anche lo strappo e tutte le finiture sembrano fatte davvero bene. PiÃ¹ adatte a stagioni invernali e mezze stagioni, meno adatte per l estate. Unico appunto, prendete un mezzo numero in meno, calzano leggermente grandi. Ottime scarpe kappa. Spero di essere stato utile. Ne ho approfittato che c\\'era lo sconto e le ho comprate qualche numero piÃ¹ grandi. Il prossimo inverno le userÃ² tantissimo. Le conosco giÃ\\xa0 e sono molto comode. Die Schuhe passen perfekt und die QualitÃ¤t ist wirklich Top. Preis Leistung stimmt und Kappa ist generell eine gute Marke. Scarpe leggere, piuttosto plasticose, nulla di che, ma mi servivano per far giocare la bimba in giardino. Prime per lo scopo Ich habe die Schuhe zweimal bestellt. Einmal fÃ¼r meinen Sohn u Einmal fÃ¼r mich. Sehr zufrieden. Belle scarpe. Molto bello il contrasto tra blu e rosa fluo. Come la foto. Vestono bene. 5 stelle! Ein sehr leichter Schuh, flexible Sohle und sieht auch fein aus. Mein Sohn mag ihn sehr gerne tragen! Sein Lieblingsschuh, egal ob Schnee oder Regen! Molto belle e di ottima fattura. I was so excited for these shoes for my son that I disregarded all of the negative reviews. But now I am stuck with the shoe that my son cannot wear because he literally tripped and fell out of the shoes because the strap is too short. I even sewed an extension on the strap to help make it longer and the velcro that is attached to the shoe is very weak. So here I am stuck with very expensive shoes for my 5-year-old that I spent a lot of money on please do not purchase these you will definitely be disappointed. My kid love it !! Love these but the strap across the top is so short it comes undone immediately. Very frustrating. Not sure what they were thinking with this. And it isnâ\\x80\\x99t just this one pair. I ordered my daughter the same pair in a different color and size and have the same issue. My son loved the shoes, very vibrant color, very good looking, very comfortable. Would be a great shoe if not the design defect in velcro that keeps the shoe attached to the kid :). The receiving part of velcro is just about half an inch in length - there is no way it\\'s enough for a kid who is running around 24/7 - as soon as he starts running the velcro detaches and shoes become useless. I hope Adidas fixes that defect in otherwise wonderful shoe. Zapatilla demasiado grande, comprÃ© talla 6 big kids, para mi sobrina de 12 aÃ±os y le quedo enorme al probarlas me ha quedado a mi soy talla en mujer #8 americano, venia en caja original y la calidad del zapato sÃ© vÃ© buena , en conclusiÃ³n para mi es original pero viene mal marcada o etiquetada o es un sale. The shoes have gold in them which is not pictured as well as no Velcro. Item is not as described. Son sÃºper bonitos y de calidad como siempre lo espero de adidasð\\x9f\\x91\\x8cð\\x9f\\x8f¼ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 We tried numerous pairs of sneakers and my kid loves this shoes best! Fits well and easy to snug up without adult help. It\\'s nice looking and super comfy, I agree with many reviewers that it misses 1 star as the strap is super short and would cause uncomfortable feeling at the feet uncle SchÃ¶ner Schuh fÃ¼r heiÃ\\x9fe Tage. Das Mesh ist oben groÃ\\x9f perforiert, so dass die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe schÃ¶n belÃ¼ftet sind.Allerdings hat man keinen starken Halt, dafÃ¼r sind sie zu instabil. Ansonsten sehr schÃ¶n und angenehm zu tragen. Super Golfschuh fÃ¼r den Sommer, luftig, leicht, sehr angenehm zu tragen Se ajustan a lo que buscaba. SchÃ¶ner Sommergolfschuh I use them on the golf course Sehr leicht und komfortabel! Zum Golfspielen TrÃ¨s jolie pour une tenue de golf comme une robe ou jupe. I live in Florida and play year-round.  The shoes have held up well through two years of wear.  I\\'m not too fond of the latest trend of wearing sandals for golf, preferring instead to have my feet shod while playing (never know when you might run into some unfriendly red ant).  And best of all, they clean up nicely.  Just drop them into the washer, and set them on a stand to dry. I e been wearing this golf shoes for years and love them. We spend our winters in Az where it can be really hot and the mesh is light and airy. My feet donâ\\x80\\x99t feel like they are on fireâ\\x80\\x99 Nearly impossible to get on their feet.  If I get a size that will slide on then they are too loose on the actual foot.  Bizarre design These are good, simple indoor shoes. My son wears them on the court and sand turf and has no problems with them. My son loves his indoor shoe My performance increased. Scorning more goals than ever This indoor shoe is a good buy and has held of great for this winter season. Exelentes, muy cÃ³modos, el pie respira atravez del material, los compre coml un regalo para mi esposa y le encantaron, al principio pensamos que el material se aflojaria con el uso diario pero por el contrario es muy resistente y no se deforma love that Skechers offer so many stylish sneakers and shoes in wide width.  these are so comfortable, like wearing ankle socks with a sole.  the toe box is super roomy, and I think it would be roomy even in regular/medium width.  the fabric of the shoe allows for even more toe movement, good for me because I don\\'t like constricting footwear.  for knockabout, running-errands footwear, you won\\'t find anything much more comfortable than this, hence the 5-star rating.  for serious walking or standing, though, these will be lacking in arch support.  and I\\'d make sure to stay on flat, even terrain because the fabric doesn\\'t provide much structure.  I could see stepping wrong and someone\\'s foot sliding right off the sole, easily causing a twisted ankle or fall.  but for what they\\'re meant for, they\\'re awesome.  my new fave shoes! The inside of the shoes say \"Ultra sock\" and that is what I would call them. A built in sock look. Very comfy. I was able to get an Amazon Warehouse deal and get them for $20! I am in love with Skechers wide with shoes. I have a hard time with shoes due to having a wide foot and needing something comfortable but stylish for a 30 something mom. I was previously buying \"cute\" Crocs brand, but they only have so many styles that aren\\'t sandals. Plus they aren\\'t cheap on Amazon and there\\'s no store near me (retailers but not a full Crocs store). So if I order online and don\\'t like them, I was stuck unless I wanted to pay return shipping. Free Amazon returns, great shoes. Makes me happy. Not enough back/heel support. Foot slides right out back. I returned these although I had a bit of a fiasco with that as had ordered a few pair of shoes and sent these to wrong place and place sent them to acted like did not have so ended up having to pay for these. A bit frustrating luckily werenâ\\x80\\x99t too costly but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not inclined to try out shoes so much now These shoes are fantastic! My feet swell in the summer heat and it is painful to wear shoes. These Skechers are in a wide size, allowing for my swelling. They are super soft and light weight. I am going to buy another pair in a different color. Love this shoe.  Got several pairs in different colors.  Try to buy a couple of new pair every year because I wear them everyday. My last 6 pairs of sneakers have been Sketchers.  I wear them out at the little toe, where they push the material apart.  I like the way they feel with the memory foam. We\\'ll have to see how long these Bounder last at the toe.  Most others last 6 to 12 months. The shoes looked good and were what I ordered. Though I got the same size as the ones I had been wearing, these are very tight. Seems to run about a 1/2 size smaller than usual. Other than that, I got what I expected. Fit great, the memory cushion is nice and gives you plenty of support. Going to buy a second pair asap. I bought these 6 months ago overall it is good product but If someone wants to wear it for work and stands for 8 to 10 hours it doesn\\'t help that much Huh. These are genuinely ugly. They are not bad. Just it. I have perfect fot the same size another model skechers and adidas shoes, but these model a little bit small. Quality for sure not the best. very light and cozy Can never go wrong with the Skechers memory foam shoe. Ein schÃ¶ner, leichter Stiefel. Hatte ihn in GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 20 bestellt. Leider sind Stiefel zum hineinschlÃ¼pfen nichts fÃ¼r unser Enkelkind. Sie bleibt im Schaft hÃ¤ngen. Wie immer alles perfekt bei Amazon. I have used Teva\\'s since the 90\\'s, but when my last pair died I decided to get something that looked a bit less \"dad sandal\" despite now being a father.  I\\'d heard good things about Chaco sandals from multiple sources and decided to take the plunge.  Sizing charts are accurate although I found them confusing.  Best thing to do is figure out your shoe size in either centimetres or European sizing and backtrack form there.  I\\'m normally a size 9 in shoes, but got the size 7 Chaco per the size chart and it fits perfect.Things I\\'ve noticed:  The straps are MUCH softer and flexible than Tevas even on the parts that aren\\'t using Velcro.  My feet appreciate that.  The sole has strong and definite arch support so if you have flat feet these might not be for you.  It\\'s also a very wide last, which is good for my hobbit feet, but wouldn\\'t work well if yours were long and narrow.  The foot bed is also very stiff compared to a Teva sandal which I assume means they will last a long time, but also take a few days to break in properly.For me, they fit well and are very comfy to wear.  I\\'m happy with the style of them as well.  I took a point off because I think they are a tad overpriced in Candada especially with the import fees being tacked on.  If I were in the US, I\\'d happily pay the amounts being asked. é\\x87\\x8dã\\x81\\x95ã\\x81\\x8cæ°\\x97ã\\x81«ã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x8aã\\x80\\x81è¿\\x94å\\x93\\x81ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x80\\x82å\\x95\\x86å\\x93\\x81ã\\x82\\x82å±¥ã\\x81\\x8då¿\\x83å\\x9c°ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x81¨ã\\x81¦ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x82\\x88ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x81®ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x83»ã\\x83»ã\\x83»ã\\x80\\x82è¿\\x94å\\x93\\x81å\\x87¦ç\\x90\\x86ã\\x82\\x82ç®±ã\\x81«å\\x85¥ã\\x82\\x8cã\\x81¦å¼\\x95ã\\x81\\x8då\\x8f\\x96ã\\x82\\x8aã\\x82\\x92å¾\\x85ã\\x81¤ã\\x81\\xa0ã\\x81\\x91ã\\x81ªã\\x81®ã\\x81§ã\\x81¨ã\\x81¦ã\\x82\\x82å\\x8a©ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x80\\x82 We are big fans of chacos.  This pair seems fine but in previous pairs the strap around ankle did not hang down so long - once the shoe is secured at ankle there are at least 3 inches of extra that almost drag the ground....not sure why this change in design.  There are videos online of how to tuck up the strap but it seems like a design flaw compared to last models. I received my 1st pair with the straps much to small to fit my feet, but I could not adjust the straps at all, like the straps were glued into position.  I returned the 1st pair, asking for a replacement.  The replacement had the same problem, the straps could not be adjusted.  When I returned the 2nd pair I was charged an $18.42 restocking fee despite that they were listed as \"FREE Returns\". Really good sandals. I loved that I could just slide them on and start wearing them without having to break them in. There was maybe a slight hassle to adjust the straps after purchase to fit my feet, but otherwise nothing too complicated. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gone hiking and biking in them and havenâ\\x80\\x99t been disappointed with the soles or straps. The only thing I have to say against them is that constant wear is abrasive to the skin, especially the toe straps. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t gotten any blisters (Iâ\\x80\\x99m not really prone to them) but they do leave marks that only go away after a couple of days of not wearing them. Otherwise, I love them! Awesome traction, even when wet! I ordered 3 different sandals from different companies and as soon as I tried these on, trying on the other 2 was just a formality. I love the strap design and the high arch (my feet needed it) and the overall build quality is inline with the price. Great buy. Too small for top of foot. If the straps would move through the loops at ankle we could have adjusted the foot area but it was sewn. Love the sandals, but a little heavier than I would have liked so I donâ\\x80\\x99t use them for backpacking as I had originally intended.  They are still awesome for using around home. I was a little concerned that these would run a little small (I usually buy size 10 but opted for 9 this time) because I\\'ve always had the impression Chacos run a little small. Happy to report that\\'s not the case. These also seem to have a lighter, less clunky sole/base material, which I was not expecting but really, really like. We\\'ll see how these new ones hold up to the daily grind. Have owned many pairs of this shoe, usually very durable.  The shoes no longer come with Vibram soles and after only a month and a half of normal use the sole is already delaminating from the shoe.  Unacceptable for this price. Toller Schuh, am Schaft recht eng.  Eine Leggings passt rein. Matschhose wird zu eng sein. FÃ¼r uns wichtig: er hÃ¤lt am Bein.  FÃ¤llt bei 20/21 grÃ¶Ã\\x9fenmÃ¤ssig wie eine 21 aus. Tut was ein Gummistiefel soll, nÃ¤mlich FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe trocken halten und sieht dabei noch ganz nett aus.. Leider war an der TÃ¼te ein Schild Gr 26/27, Inhalt jedoch 24/25.... retour Gut Sehr schÃ¶ne Gummistiefel.An denen gibt es nichts zu meckern.Sind wasserdicht und mein 14 Monate alter Sohn kann sehr gut drin laufen. Bellissimi Sehr schÃ¶ne Schuhe Spitze Ma fille n\\'a pas pu les mettre car trop petits mais conforme Ã\\xa0 la description I like the design. Don\\'t feel very comfortable . they fit perfect and look perfect... other than the fact that it looks like they had previously been worn. a couple of dirt marks on it but overall theyâ\\x80\\x99re still good shoes Loved them. A little too big tho Incomodas I spent a lot of my childhood barefoot and have struggled for years to find shoes that fit my wide toes, very narrow heel feet.They offer NO arch support which isnâ\\x80\\x99t a problem for me, but could be for others. My shoes fit perfectly and Iâ\\x80\\x99m even sure I could add an insole if I wanted.I mainly purchased these as gym shoes that have some sort of toe grip for certain exercises but Iâ\\x80\\x99m excited to try them out in the summer time in the river, too! Was a great fit for wide feet.  Will not accomodate too well socks (unless they are super thin).I will buy them again. Seems these are made with less care then I would have hoped for. There is glue clearly used to put the shoe together  that has not been cleaned up at all. And they are too tight to wear. I hope they loosen up with use. size is true Very comfortable beautiful purple color I do like this shoe very comfortable My son loves them, he thinks he can run faster with these on. They fit great, & seem durable and comfortable. Look great too. Great shoes my son love it. Comodidad Great shoe, arrived quite late but product is good Bought these for my daughter who absolutely loves them. She is a picky person when it comes to shoes because she has a wide foot which can be hard to find a good looking great fitting shoe. They are perfect for her and she said she never wants to take them off so in all I  am glad I bought them. Quality: These do not seem like authentic adidas. They have a very strange look in person. I do not like them at all and nor does my child.Fit: I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend ordering these but if you do, make sure your kiddo has a narrow foot and order a half size up at least. My daughter really likes these shoes and does everything in them. It\\'s just unfortunate that the shiny stripes started peeling off within the first week of wear. Now 3 are peeling off and flapping around and it just looks really sloppy, as though she\\'s been wearing them for a couple years instead of a couple months! My mom got so concerned seeing the state of her shoes a couple weeks ago that she\\'s ordering her another pair ð\\x9f¤£. But, other than making me look like a negligent mom, they\\'re comfortable and lightweight and cute. Great looking shoe!  I love the look of these on my son.  As boys do though, he is pretty rough on clothes and shoes.  The fabric that covers the top of the toes (looks like of like mesh) got a couple of small holes in it after a couple of months and now after ~3-4 months of wearing them the entire piece of fabric on the top of the shoe is basically flapping in the breeze it\\'s pulled back so far.  The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok, so I guess more of a cosmetic issue, but still annoying.  Not sure I\\'d buy these again simply because of that, but I did love them for the first couple of months! I thought adidas would offer a quality material but my 6 year old son already was able to wear it out the tip of the shoes within two months. All he has been doing with the shoes is walking, running, biking , playing in recess outside in school. He does not play soccer so kicking or something like that is not the reason why the fronts torn out. Looked great to start but after a few short weeks the front plastic toe started to crack open. Typical daily use! Would not recommend this product. Meravigliose come solo geox li sa fare. Viste al negozio, ma non c\\'era il numero, poi il prezzo era doppio. Con il prezzo Amazon morbidezza e comoditÃ\\xa0 sono davvero uniche. Geox Ã¨ sempre una garanzia, scarpe comode e calde e zone sempre il piede non suda.

Consegna ultra rapida ...nur der Preis ist etwas zu hoch. Diese Schuhe sollten im Preis unter â\\x82¬ 28,-- liegen, was sie durchaus wert sind. Lediglich Marke und/oder Beliebtheit treiben den Preis unangemessen hoch. Hat alles schnell geklappt und der Schuh ist einwandfrei. Belle basket, bien dÃ©couper, jolie finition,tienne bien,couleur bleu gris un peut comme un jeans claire !! I love this brand! every pair of shoes or boots I\\'ve worn outlast my expectations. I will likely never find a manufacturer like this in my lifetime so I hope they never go out of business. The quality is far better than the average and that\\'s putting it lightly Arrived in a NON GENUINE Box with NO MERRELL labels of any kind either on the shoes or box. I highly doubt these are genuine. And yes they were from Amazon not a third party seller. These shoes were comfortable right away. I usually wear a heavier hiker so these are nice and light for the summer Love these shoes were them to Vegas and walked for Miles no foot pain Great shoe, very light, good grips for hiking,Was priced at $60 when I bought them Excellent produit, rÃ©sistant et confortable. Merrell is no longer a brand of longevity but it still costs the same as it used to. Enfin un soulier de marche confortable est qui semble durable :) beautiful shoes, thanks Amazon.ca Parfais Schnell wurden diese Schuhe geliefert und tatsÃ¤chlich sind sie eng. Der ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss kann an meinem Fuss nicht wie bei einem anderen ARA Paar nachtrÃ¤glich geschlossen werden.Das FuÃ\\x9fbett ist total angenehm, man lÃ¤uft ganz anders. HÃ¶her, gerader? Wie lange ich es aushalte, werde ich sehen.AuÃ\\x9fen Leder, Innen \"Frottee\"?, Sehr sportlicher Schuh, war mir fÃ¼r den sehr gÃ¼nstigen Preis egal. Viel mehr hÃ¤tte ich nicht ausgegeben, da der Schuh unerwartet echt eng ist, trotz SchnÃ¼rung und trotz des ReiÃ\\x9fverschlusses.FÃ¼r breite FÃ¼sse wurde ich sagen ungeeignet. Von der SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe her ideal aber leider zu schmal wer etwas breite FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe hat. Das Fussbett ist zwar weich und ergonomisch aber fÃ¼r 8 Stunden Arbeit mit hin und herlaufen nicht geeignet. FÃ¼r mich unbequem und die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe tun schrecklich weh. Ich werde sie als Sommerschuh tragen aber mehr auch nicht. HÃ¤tte ich dafÃ¼r 129â\\x82¬ ausgegeben hÃ¤tte ich es bereut. Ansich ein gut verarbeiteter Schuh Wie immer sind die Schuhe von ARA super bequem...innen mit Frottee...schÃ¶n weich....man lÃ¤uft wie auf Wolken...bin begeistert...kaufe mir eventuell noch andere Farben wenn sie billiger werden....auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert Ein wirklich toller Schuh, lÃ¤uft sich echt angenehm. Sieht auch zu einem sportlichen Rock richtig gut aus.FÃ¼r den Preis klare Kaufempfehlung. Die Schuhe sind getragen oder unter eine Walze gekommen.Sohle kaputt unmÃ¶glich so einen Artikel zu verschicken.total dreckig. SchÃ¶ner bequemer Schuh Elles sont gÃ©niales, comme les autres de la marque d\\'ailleurs !!! Bien adaptÃ© Very good looking.

You can wear them all day very comfy Love these casual shoes My daughter loves these. They were true to size and decent for the price. Would buy more. She also gets compliments every time she wears them. looked great love the color will order more These were stiff when I first got them but they have broke in some Absolutely in love with my sunflower shoes. They are perfect ð\\x9f\\x8c» Son lindos, pero son demasiado grandes, si pedÃ\\xad mi talla pero igual estÃ¡n muy grandes Cute and comfy, but they do run big The shoes would be awesome if they weren\\'t so huge. I got my regular size, but they\\'re way too big. Tried them on and they were roomy, so I wanted to wear them to see how they\\'d work out, but I can\\'t wear them because my feet slide around. Super disappointed, they\\'re super cute. LOVE THESE SHOES Beautiful shoe, but too narrow.Edit: I ended up keeping them and donating to a neighborhood kid. My son loved them so much he wore them everywhere. Too bad they donâ\\x80\\x99t last as long .. but it could be that he did overuse them . True to size, great quality, laces are not too short and not too long. My son said theyâ\\x80\\x99re comfy Shoes seemed nice but my son has wide feet and these did not work.  Some adidas shoes run wide but these did not. My 9 year old son uses these for indoor soccer and loves them. my son loved them.great fit. They fit perfectly Muy bueno pero muy frande PERFECTO TAL CUAL LO ESPERABAMOS So comfy reinschlÃ¼pfen und loslaufen. Bequem, wie erwartet. Andere Schuhe mÃ¼ssen oft eingelaufen werden, war bei diesem Paar nicht erforderlich. Excellent produit Ã\\xa0 enfiler et trÃ¨s confortables! Son muy cÃ³modos. Los utilizo para trabajar, en especial en las guardias. I purchased this pair because I wanted another sneaker from Ecco, but I wanted something that was a slip-on with a less traditional style than the lace-up sneaker of which I have 5 pair from Ecco in various colors, and this fit the bill.  As with all Eccos, I can fit my custom orthotic inside with ease and somehow it does not compromise the fit of the shoe whatsoever (I wear a half orthotic which only supports the heel and arch of my foot and does not go to the toe).  The arch support without the orthotic is fair on its own and the bottom is more flexible than the other Ecco sneakers that I have, but I expected that with the style of this shoe and was what I wanted.  The sole of this shoe is not rigid so if you need that this will not provide that for you.  It is an extremely light shoe and breathable which is perfect for the warmer months.  Lately these are the pair that I grab the most and get a lot of compliments on them. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re different than the average sneaker. They are sleeker and extremely comfortable and work with a lot of outfits, obviously more casual looks but I did wear them with skorts and cute top on vacation recently and they were perfect.  Also, great at airports when you need to slip your shoes off when going through security and super comfortable when youâ\\x80\\x99re just sitting in your seat for hours on the plane ride, and really light to pack.  Highly recommend. I got these to wear at work - I\\'m in medical and live in scrubs.  I\\'m on my feet all day.  These are so comfy and adorable!  I get so many compliments on them :)  I wear a 7.5 and I ordered a 38.  Fits PERFECT!! I like Ecco shoes.  I have a couple of pairs.  I was looking for something to slip in and out easily for work with arch support.  These fit the image but they scratched the top of my foot.  There is no inner lining so everything feels rough.  Had to return. Not like other pairs of Ecco I have - too short. Also, even though my instep is almost non existent, it was too tight around my foot to the point when it becomes painful after a couple of minutes just having them on. Sent them back. Liked the style and color.  I tend to need a narrow heel with a medium width foot bed.  Ecco usually works for me, but this shoe slipped in the heel and I had to return them.  They ran wider than usual. Super comfy for doing a lot of walking in the airport and travels. A snug fit to put on but didn\\'t slip on my narrow heel. Plenty of room in the toe box. I\\'ve had it for just a few months and its starting to wear. The other ecco shoes I have keep going for years I\\'m new to the world of variable sized shoes, but these feel great for walking, around the house, and even a little basketball.  Regarding size/fit, order wider than your usual.  I am slow to criticize on fit since I am just figuring out variable sized footwear.  But even compared to other Propet footwear, this one is much narrower.  The photo is two right Propet shoes, both size 14 and width 5E.  Note that the strap of the black shoe completely covers the Velcro, but the grey sneaker was close to not being wide enough with about an inch of Velcro showing.  So far it\\'s holding with less Velcro contact.  I hope so since that\\'s their widest width, and these feel great. The tongues have a lot of loose threads on both shoes. Its really comfy otherwise and breathes extremely well. I don\\'t like seeing so many loose threads though. It makes me wonder how many other spots that I haven\\'t or can\\'t see have sewing problems, too. Its a shame because its very comfy otherwise. I purchased these for my brother who lives in a nursing home. We both loved the looks of the shoes and the fit was right on target. I returned them because when he tried them on I saw the soles seemed to stick to the carpet a bit. I was afraid he\\'d fall, which he is already inclined to do, because he doesn\\'t pick up his feet well. There were other shoes I ordered which did not exhibit this problem. I bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them. Good fit, good stability, excellent quality.Would definitely recommend. I bought this pair for the gym. Its very difficult to tighten the shoe enough that I won\\'t step out of it while working out If you have young healthy feet this product may be for you. I have wide worn down feet and this shoe has zero support. It is easy to operate but the padding is less then effective. I liked the way that the shoe fit. I have always had problems with wide feet. They are my go to shoes for outside and to the gym, however, after two months of usage and outside of the return policy, the sides of the shoes are pulling apart. I would not buy them again. bought these late in season, may be wrong choice fo winter . I was hesitant to purchase these sneakers for my son because I was unfamiliar with the brand. However, my son loves the fit, comfort and style. They worked out well for a work environment that eats shoes, held out longer than several other Shoes I\\'ve tried, They wore out after 5 months, but that\\'s at 6 days a week in a warehouse job for 10 hours a day. Not bad when they went on sale for around $45 Super schÃ¶ner Schuh! Meine Kleine liebt ihn!Wir werden ihn wieder kaufen! FÃ¼r zierliche FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe geeignet. Sehr hochwertig verarbeitet! Wir nutzen ihn auch als Ballerina fÃ¼r auÃ\\x9fen!Meine 2 JÃ¤hrige schaft es prima sie selbstÃ¤ndig an und auszuziehen. Sehr schÃ¶ne Schuhe in bewehrter QualitÃ¤t. Sie passen wie erwartet, sind gut verarbeitet und rutschfest. Meine Tochter kann sie mit dem Klettverschluss selbst anziehen und trÃ¤gt sie sehr gerne. Die SchÃ¼hchen kÃ¶nnen nicht nur als Hausschuhe getragen werden. Sie sind sehr leicht, die Sohle flexibel, aber fÃ¼r schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe geeignet. Not only are they very stylish and chic, they\\'re also well-built, sturdy and very easy to clean. Not the cheapest slippers but they are definitely worth every penny. ZuckersÃ¼Ã\\x9fe Hausschuhe, nur haben sich nach nur zweimaligem Tragen die kleinen applizierten BlÃ¼mchen abgelÃ¶st. Sehr schade fÃ¼r Schuhe mit diesem Preis. Tolle Sommerhausschuhe. QualitÃ¤t und GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe wie gewohnt von Living KitzbÃ¼hel!! Absolute Kaufempfehlung!!! If you\\'re at all familiar with the Clarks reputation for comfortable shoes then there is really no need to read any reviews as Clarks are always a good decision and this pair of shoes is no different. I can wear these shoes for hours without my foot feeling any pain and they\\'re breathable enough to prevent the shoe from getting too hot inside and creating an atmosphere in which odors can fester. The shoes look just as they do in the pictures so there\\'s no surprises there either. Sneaker is comfortable and looks good. Shoelaces come untied easily. These things are noises. It makes a squishing noise as I walk. They are expensive for what you get. You could buy almost 3 pairs of Sketchers for this price. Hermosos The product is genuine and exactly as described .. happy with it, just hope the size chart to have more options for British sizes Pair is little bigger I would like to return this pair and I want to get in size:10. ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d liked it Los zapatos son para mi bebÃ© de casi 2 aÃ±os pero los comprÃ© un poco mÃ¡s grandes ya que conseguÃ\\xad una super oferta por Amazon. Los zapatos son originales y fueron enviados desde Estados Unidos. No tuve que pagar tax ni ningÃºn impuesto al llegar a MÃ©xico pues ya venÃ\\xadan incluidos en el precio. Una real oferta pues no pague mÃ¡s de 400 pesos por los zapatos originales cuando en la tienda New Balance no bajan de 1000 pesos.  Excelente calidad y materiales  Se los guardo hasta que ya le queden sin embargo, soy feliz! Calidad insuperable fÃ¡ciles de limpiar y el material es muy resistente contra agua la verdad son mis favoritos!!! El precio inigualable!! PÃ©simo, se supone que son hechos para que tengan buena resistencia y por eso los compre. Pero desafortunadamente no duraron ni 6 meses y eso que solo fueron usados en casa. Ni siquiera para ir al parque al algo similar Super buen precio/calidad. Mi hijo no se los quita, estÃ¡n muy cÃ³modos y no se ensucian tan fÃ¡cil. A buen precio puesto en Mexico El producto es de calidad, se ven geniales! Le encantaron a mi hijo. En general estÃ¡n bien, siento que la suela se resbala un poco y no son muy acolchonados por dentro. El color estÃ¡ increÃ\\xadble y llegaron al tiempo que indicaron Estan muy bonitos y quedaron super bien Muy emocionado y contento quedÃ³ al niÃ±o.  Gracias ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 Me gustaron mucho, son muy bonitos y de excelente calidad... Pero, hablando de comodidad, no son cÃ³modos realmente. El modelo, diseÃ±o y comodidad son excelentes, solo la tela del teni se debe tener los cuidados necesarios ya que estÃ¡n algo frÃ¡giles. Al ser calzado Americano suele venir un poco mas amplio, el diseÃ±o es padre y el tiempo de entrega genial. Muy cÃ³modos pero deberÃ\\xadan poner numeraciÃ³n en cm Excelentes Me encantaron! Son verdaderamente bellos!! Iâ\\x80\\x99m a 6.5 narrow, I bought these because I needed a snicker that could hold my ankle while working out after an injury. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not the shoe for that. The high top style is really for style, there is no ankle hold. I was also struggling a lot to get my foot in and out.Looks really cute, itâ\\x80\\x99s light weight, but I had to send it back, it was too much of a hassle and did not fit my purpose. I love puma shoes! It is basically all I wear. But very disappointed when my shoes arrived and I opened to see them with stains on them and look as if they been worn prior to sending. And itâ\\x80\\x99s a real hassle to return right now during all this stuff going on. I fe like I just got swindled out of my money Comfortable, cute, lightweight and true to size. Personally love these. I use them to workout and not outside just because I donâ\\x80\\x99t wanna get them dirty Love these shoes. Purchased these for more ankle support when working out. They provide great support overall, a firm sole while not being so stiff that itâ\\x80\\x99s uncomfortable. I\\'ve had the older version of these for years and they\\'ve served me well. I bought these and didn\\'t bother breaking them in this winter because I found them narrow even though they said wide. I\\'ll work on breaking them in though and hope they do me for years like the older ones. Me gusta mucho el zapato columbia, protege mucho mis pies, no me cansa.  este modelo en especial, viene un poco mÃ¡s amplio de lo normal, manejo 7.5 en mis compras,  sin embargo me lo quedÃ©, solo uso un calcetÃ\\xadn mÃ¡s grueso.el color es combinable con mucha ropa. lo uso para andar en la ciudad. Recomendable I love this shoe. Very very comfortable. Im between 9.5 and 10, I took size 10 M and it\\'s perfect for a foot that isn\\'t wide. Solid yet flexible. SÃºper bonitos para usarse hasta para ir al sÃºper me dolÃ\\xada la rodilla y el dolor se fue cuando me puse los tenis del diario en lugar de sandalias los recomendÃ³ Great shoes, look just like picture. I ordered half size up for socks. Fit perfectly seem like a great quality product. Super happy! Love these shoes!  I have wide feet and theyâ\\x80\\x99re super comfy.  I probably could have got the 8.5s, but with socks the 9s are great.  They feel great on, heavy duty but comfortable. Todo bien con la compra. Zapato rÃ\\xadgido, tal y como debe ser. Like that it is water proof Great for walking on both smooth and rougher pathways. Also used them for golf - great traction. Cumplieron su objetivo, hice senderismo en un bosque lluvioso y tuvieron buen agarre, a pesar de que no son waterproof soportaron bien la lluvia y el lodo. Ich liebe die Schuhe. Sehr gutes laufgefÃ¼hl, halten sogar etwas warm, gut gepolzterte einlegesohle schon drin. Material FÃ¤rbt nicht ab, bis 150kg super gut belastbar auch zum joggen geeignet. Ich habe mir gedacht, dass diese Schuhe eine gute DÃ¤mpfung haben mÃ¼ssten und habe mich deshalb fÃ¼r sie entschieden. Ein anderes Modellsprach mich zwar mehr an, war in meiner GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe aber nicht mehr zu bekommen. Sie sind ganz fix gekommen, ohne viel unnÃ¶tige Verpackung und haben nicht auffÃ¤llig gerochen. Normale Passform und mit Sneaker oder Socken super zu tragen, reinzwÃ¤ngeln muss ich mich auch nicht.SchuhlÃ¶ffel reicht, vorne Ã¼ber dem Spann richten/hochziehen und los geht\\'s. Habe sie einen Vormittag im Haus getragen und mittags dann wegen warmer FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe ausgezogen. Ich empfand sie als angenehm, nicht zu locker und die DÃ¤mpfung war so, wie ich sie mir vorgestellt habe.Ich habe Probleme mit den Gelenken und deshalb diese dicken Sohlen. WÃ¤ren sie als \"Schietwetterschuhe\" zu bekommen, fÃ¼r HundespaziergÃ¤nge, wÃ¼rde ich mich freuen. Meine Tochter sucht sich bereits welche fÃ¼r die Kita. als Hausschuhe aus.Wenn Sie jetzt noch gut halten, dann war das die absolut richtige Wahl(fÃ¼r mich). Am Schuh ansich gibt\\'s nicht zu meckern. Allerdings wÃ¼rde ich beim nÃ¤chsten Kauf eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellen. Trage eine normale 38, jedoch durch dich Machart und ohne SchnÃ¼rung, zieht sich der Schuh sehr schwer an. Ist man erstmal drin, sitz er gut aber doch eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer. Trotzdem bin ich mit dem Schuh zufrieden An sich bestimmt ein toller Schuh wenn man nicht gerade angeschwollene 9-Monats-SchwangerschaftsfÃ¼Ã\\x9fe hat.Habe die Schuhe geholt, da ich (gerade bei dem aktuellen Wetter) rutschfeste Schuhe brauche in die man auch (aufgrund des mittlerweile dicken Bauch) einfach rein schlÃ¼pfen kann.Leider empfand ich die Artikelbeschreibung als etwas irrefÃ¼hrend, da ich davon ausging dass der gesamte FuÃ\\x9f aus elastischem Material bestehen und sich somit dem FuÃ\\x9f anpassen wÃ¼rde. Da ich ziemliche Wassereinlagerungen in den Beinen/FÃ¼Ã\\x9fen  habe und nur der \"Eingang\" elastisch ist, kam ich jedoch nicht mal ansatzweise in den Schuh hinein, weswegen er zurÃ¼ck gehen wird.Schade, rutschfest und bequem wirkte er dennoch. Wirklich schÃ¶ne Schuhe, preisgÃ¼nstig und sehen gut verarbeitet aus. Aber und jetzt kommt das ABER: Ich hab wirklich keine sonderlich breiten FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe. Eher normal. Mir passen sonst alle Schuhe, aber diese hier waren viel zu eng. Nicht nach vorne hin sondern an den Seiten. Nach 1h tragen hatte ich unglaubliche FuÃ\\x9fschmerzen bekommen weil durchgehend ein starker Druck von den Seiten herrschte. Schade, ich habe mich nÃ¤mlich Anfangs sehr gefreut, weil die Schuhe klasse aussehen.Habe die Schuhe heute schweren Herzen Retour geschickt...Update: Retour und Erstattung gingen Problemlos und sehr schnell Ã¼ber die BÃ¼hne! Ich hÃ¤tte doch eine halbe Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellen sollen. Ich brauchte die Schuhe dringend, sodass ich fÃ¼r den Umtausch etc. keine Geduld hatte.Da sie ja aus Stoff sind, haben sie sich noch etwas geweitet, somit sind sie jetzt sehr bequem. Ich laufe sehr viel damit, verwende sie allerdings zum Gassi gehen und nicht zum joggen.WÃ¼rde sie wieder kaufen. Von der GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe her passt es sehr gut leider ist der Schuh nur fÃ¼r schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe geeignet. Werde also warten bis mein sohn die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe erreicht hat und sie ihm dann geben fÃ¼r mich persÃ¶nlich nicht das wahre. Wenn man von der enge absieht steht man sehr gut darin und kann auch super laufen. Die Schuhe sind genial.Ich habe schon Ã¤hnliche von Skechers,die aber nicht so gut passen wie diese.Absolut empfehlenswert!!!Die Sohle ist ganz weich und die Schuhe bequem.Preis-Leistung ist top!FÃ¼r Skechers Schuhe bezahlt man locker das doppelte.Ich habe die Schuhe jetzt knapp drei Monate je nach Wetterlage in Gebrauch und ich muss sagen QualitÃ¤t ist super.Es muss nicht immer nur ein Markenprodukt sein. Die QualitÃ¤t und Verarbeitung der Schuhe scheint in Ordnung zu sein. Auch optisch gefÃ¤llt er mir.Er ist schmal geschnitten und leider fÃ¤llt die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe etwas knapp aus, ein halbe GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe mehr wÃ¤re toll. Allerdings weiÃ\\x9f ich noch nicht wie sich der Schuh nach lÃ¤ngerem Tragen verhÃ¤lt..das Obermaterial ist aus nachgibigem, gestrickten Stoff. Wird nach lÃ¤ngerem Tragen das Material  nachgeben?...schreibe spÃ¤ter nochmal eine Anmerkung dazu.Leider musste ich die Schuhe zurÃ¼ck senden, da sie doch zu klein und schmal sind. Der Schuh ist super bequem und leicht. Durch die Puffersohle sehr RÃ¼cken und HÃ¼ftfreundlich.Was mir nicht gefÃ¤llt ist das er vorne an der Zehenkuppe ausbeult. Die Rundung kÃ¶nnte etwas stabiler sein so dass  diese nicht aus ihrer Form gerÃ¤t. Beim Tragen entstehen unschÃ¶ne Dellen. Ich stopfe sie nach dem Tragen immer mit Zeitungspapier aus damit die Dellen nicht bleiben und um die Rundung wieder schÃ¶n zu machen.Daher 1 Punkt Abzug. Auf diese Hausschuhe bin ich aufgrund einer Empfehlung gestoÃ\\x9fen. Zu Beginn hat mich der recht hohe Preis fÃ¼r Kinderhausschuhe doch etwas abgeschreckt, aber ich bereue den Kauf auf keinen Fall. Eher im Gegenteil: Nachdem ich diese Schuhe meinem Sohn angezogen habe und eine Woche ihn damit beobachtet habe, kann ich diese Hausschuhe zu 100% weiterempfehlen. Mit der rutschfesten Sohle, die super flexibel ist, fÃ¼hlt sich der Schuhe wie ein BarfuÃ\\x9fschuh an und auch die QualitÃ¤t des gesamten Schuhs hat uns sehr Ã¼berzeugt. Der Schuhe ist sogar fÃ¼r breite FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe gut geeignet. Bei uns werden definitiv nur noch Nanga Hausschuhe einziehen. Komplett flexible Sohle und sehr gute Breite, definitiv als BarfuÃ\\x9f-Hausschuhe zu bezeichnen. Die Sohle ist abwaschbar und gibt einen rutschfesten Halt. Der Schuh ist sowieso bei 30 Grad waschbar. Aus Biobaumwolle und Naturkautschuk. Das Gangbild war sofort perfekt und wer mit den neuen Hausschuhen gleich losflitzen kann, hat die richtigen Schuhe. Der Preis ist angemessen. Supertolle Hausschuhe, wie ich finde. \"Barfussschuhe\" sozusagen = sehr weiche und dÃ¼nne Sohle, rutschfest, aber ohne Profil und ohne Fussbett, so dass die KinderfÃ¼sse natÃ¼rlich gehen kÃ¶nnen und so eigentlich ein Barfussfeeling fÃ¼r den Fuss entsteht und die Koordination und Bewegungsentwicklung frei und natÃ¼rlich stattfinden kann, trotzdem sind sie geschÃ¼tzt und gewÃ¤rmt. Ist schon unsere vierte GrÃ¶sse glaube ich. Kaufe nur die, bin sehr Ã¼berzeugt und zufrieden! Erst einmal muss man sagen lt. Testberichte sollen diese Schuhe ohne Chemie auskommen. Das kann mein Geruchstest nur bestÃ¤tigen. FÃ¼hlen sich gut an und sind leicht. Jetzt kommt das ABER. Was ich schade finde, wir hÃ¤tten sie gern behalten.In der LÃ¤nge fallen sie etwas grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer aus, leider ist der Spann zu eng. Der Gummizug ist nicht flexibel genug. Das ist wirklich Ã¤rgerlich. Hier sollte nachgebessert werden! Dann ist es ein Top Schuh! Wir hatten noch nie Hausschuhe, die nach kurzem, unregelmÃ¤Ã\\x9figem Tragen so ausgesehen haben, nicht mal um ein vielfaches gÃ¼nstigere. Ich habe beim 1. Mangelpaar Ersatz angefordert und das Ersatzpaar sieht jetzt so aus, also habe ich jedenfalls kein Montagsprodukt erwischt. Ich kann die guten Rezensionen Ã¼berhaupt nicht nachvollziehen; bei uns ist Nanga unten durch. Le pantofole sono carine, ma non sono adatte al piede del mio bimbo, l\\' elastico sul collo del piede gli stringeva troppo. Ma il servizio clienti Amazon Ã¨ stato perfetto, le ho mandate indietro e mi hanno restituito i soldi. Con Nanga vado sul sicuro, in piÃ¹ le ho trovate ad un prezzo davvero stracciato. Sono ottime per i piedini dei bimbi perchÃ¨ hanno la suola impermeabile ed isolata dal pavimento ma ultraflessibile. Assolutamente identiche a pantofone similari della concorrenza che costano ben di piÃ¹. Mio figlio appena indossate ha esordito con â\\x80\\x9csono comodissime Mamma!!!â\\x80\\x9d. Ottimo acquisto sia come qualitÃ¡ che come modello. Un poâ\\x80\\x99 strette da infilare ma una volta indossate il bambino puÃ² giocare liberamente. Io le ho comprate per lâ\\x80\\x99asilo e le consiglio vivamente! Habe den Schuh in GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 22 fÃ¼r meine Tochter bestellt. Obwohl er grundsÃ¤tzlich vorne gut passt und sie noch etwas Luft hat, ist er durch den unverstellbaren Gummizug wahnsinnig eng, obwohl sie keinen breiten FuÃ\\x9f hat. Man kommt so kaum in den Schuh hinein und er muss dadurch unbequem sein, denn er wird meist direkt wieder ausgezogen. Schade, denn laut aktuellen Testberichten enthÃ¤lt er keine bedenklichen RÃ¼ckstÃ¤nde. Werde vielleicht einen anderen Schuh dieser Marke versuchen,  der ein Riemchen hat und nicht dieses feste Gummiband. Die Hausschuhe sind ein echter Hingucker,von guter QualitÃ¤t und halten gut am relativ schmalen FuÃ\\x9f unseres Sohnes. Der Schuh ist bei uns seit 2,5 Monaten im Kindergarten in Gebrauch... bis jetzt sind keine Abnutzungserscheinungen aufgetreten. Son hermosos!Yo los agarrÃ© con descuento y no me arrepiento de haberlos compradoSon muy lindo y estÃ¡n muy cÃ³modosLas agujetas venÃ\\xadan un poquito manchadas pero es lo de menosAÃºn no he salido con ellos puestos pero me los probÃ© y estÃ¡n geniales Me gustan que sean blancos, obviamente se ensucian mucho pero hay que lavarlos y vuelven a quedar como antes Excelente producto Buen diseÃ±o y muy cÃ³modos Muy buen producto! Solo que vienen reducidos en tamaÃ±o, pidan medio nÃºmero mas grande o hasta el nÃºmero completo. EstÃ¡ exactamente como lo querÃ\\xada, me encantÃ³!!!. Excelente calidad y llegÃ³ antes del tiempo pactado. Totalmente  satisfecho cumple con todo ademÃ¡s de que estÃ¡n mejor que en las fotos El tallaje esta muy bien, llegaron antes de lo indicado. Excelente artÃ\\xadculo SÃºper cÃ³modos y hermosos! These are perfect even for an adult.I am a womenâ\\x80\\x99s size 8. I was told thatâ\\x80\\x99s a youth / big kids size 6.These fit perfect with like a 1/2 inch to spare which I like the room in slippers.These were a little hard and stiff out of the box but what slippers arnt?These are awesome! I love them. They are my new favs. I have other ugg ones that keep my feet too hot. I love these more. These are great. I recommend them.  They will break in with time. I love the look. I know they will last longer then a $20 pair that break down in a week. I wish I could leave photos. I am an adult who wears a child\\'s size 3 shoe. It is difficult for me to find a very comfortable, durable, adult looking slipper.  These are perfect.  They are not too wide, like most children\\'s shoes  I buy. My floors are hard and the thick cushioned soles are wonderful to my feet.  I will wear them from my living room outdoors to water my patio plants.  The suede is durable, quality material and water spots just fade away.  The fur lining keeps my feet warm as well. Even in the summer months my feet stay cold.  I praise the manufacturers of these slippers. Super cute slippers but much roomier than other UGG scuff slippers.  There is no sheepskin on the top underside of the slipper which makes the fit different than other styles.  Length is the same. Love the leopard print and best of all it is warm and saves my legs from standing on tile. Uggâ\\x80\\x99s are my favorite slippers during winter. I got a size 6 big kids and I am a size 8 in womenâ\\x80\\x99s. They fit perfect. I love these so much!!! The only thing the sole is a little hard but over time I know uggs get soft and adapt to your foot. So itâ\\x80\\x99s all good. Would recommend. Super cute, high quality UGG slippers with non-slip sole; extremely comfortable and stylish. Fits true to size. There great ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a The footbed is very firm.  Returned these to get something with memory foam. Unlike other UGG slippers I\\'ve purchased this pair had thin sole and little support. My 5 year old loves them'"

used to but the style is so worth it The shoes are very cute but after the 2nd day of wearing them the tongue started ripping After the 3rd day of wearing them the plastic on the side ripped They could have ripped bc I was wearing them to work and I do a lot of walking at work If youâ\\x80\\x99re going to buy these I donâ\\x80\\x99t recommend wearing them on days where you will do a lot of walking or they might rip Good quality Great Ho scelto il modello bianco con rifinitura dietro nera e posso dire che da vicino le scarpe sono ancora piÃ¹ belle il mio numero Ã¨ 38 385 ed ho ordinato il numero 38 e mi va beneSpedizione veloce il pacco Ã¨ arrivato anche prima del previsto prezzo ottimo dato che in giro costano almeno 10 15 euro in piÃ¹ Sono solita comprare scarpe Guess e non ho mai avuto problemi con la taglia in questo caso invece mi sono arrivate delle scarpe che nonostante fossero il solito numero che prendo sono molto piccole sembra quasi due numeri meno quindi immettibili Le scarpe sono molto belle calzano perfettamente Semplicemente perfette Io uso plantari su misura per piede piatto e dentro queste scarpe ci stanno perfettamente La scarpa Ã¨ comoda e da una buona stabilitÃ\\xa0 al piede Le consiglio Le scarpe sono bellissime arrivate in perfetto stato con una spedizione impeccabile purtroppo il 41 mi andava stretto e non fanno il 42 le ho dovute restituire il

Stupendeforse un po troppo grandima sicuramente ho sbagliato io Molto bello proprio come nelle foto  comode e puoi abbinarci qualsiasi cosaSuper sodisfatta grazie True to size If between Id probably go with your lower end ie 885 go 8 I wore these right out of the box for a little over 2 hours most of which was walking around and they were incredibly comfortable no rubbing and I did not find any issue with the tongue being too stiff as I have seen mentioned in other reviews This is the second pair I bought Loved the first pair however not pleased with the 2nd pair There is no padding in the tongue part of the shoe and it is causing irritation to my skin where it rubs I am very disappointed and will not buy them again I love these shoes so much its my second pair pure comfort  Thank you Amazon I have hard to fit feet and often a wide fitting shoe looks too big and bulky  These shoes were comfortable right away with no pressure points  I use them for run around shoes going to the store etc  They look casual but are more attractive than a running shoe  They have a nice rounded toe box and go with any kind of outfit  I am very happy with them

I really need 11 12 but these shoes do not come in half sizes  My right foot fits size 11 fine but not the same for the left foot  The only issue is the blue insole  my feet perspire and the blue colour runs into my socks  Also the round laces look nice but they do not remain tied they need a knot in the bow to maintain the tie  They are very attractive shoes and do not look huge in size 12

Great quality and comfort shoesI was so thrilled when I got my new shoes last week I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced By the way my original pair that are 2 12 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that werenâ\\x80\\x99t grungy looking I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking Very wellmade and beautiful and striking I would NOT recommend these for running They have zero support and I could feel the rocks in the ground through the shoe They are also shaped really weird The sole protrudes out in the back all around the heel and makes your foot appear much larger than it should These shoes are cute online but in personnot so muchThe shoe is super light weight and flimsy feeling  Because of this it feels as if there is no supportstabilityMy partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoeThe shoe not only has aquacolored accents shoe string eyelets but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and toe of the shoe to twist upward  Not a nice look  At that point I decided that I didnt want to struggle with getting the shoe on each time  Im returning them Very comfortable Absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes They run slightly too big But that doesnt take away from the comfort Im not sliding around inside them Im able to work in them well and workout in them great Excellent pair of shoes I like the style and weight of this shoe just right for wearing all day  Good quality components  However as other reviewers have said the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable  In fact the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves I could not possibly wear these shoes like that  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragonâ\\x80\\x99s  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support  Dilemma should I send them back or go buy 6 or 7 sets of insoles at the drug store to see if any of them will work  So disappointing The tongue is long stiff and rough It rubs my ankles raw I have been trying to find a casual but not too casual shoe for work I wanted an athletic shoe fit in a shoe that doesnt look like an athletic shoe This is pretty close It works well with chinos or colored denim They would not look right with dress pants but for business casual its good Im always between 8 and 85 I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly  I also need good support and these are reasonable I have another pair of Aravon shoes mary jane and they also work well I think this is good brand I thought they were really cute and fit good but after I decided to wear them around for a day I mopped the floor like I Do every day and I almost slipped so the shoes will not be good for me and my lifestyle very slippery pretty much no tread it would be good for walking as long as youâ\\x80\\x99re never honest with Service but I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to take my chances so back to Searching for a new pair of shoes Id give them 5 stars if it werent for the fact that the material on the inside of the shoe keeps pulling on my socks its not all the time but its frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up which find their way down into my shoes after walking for 1015 min also the laces dont seem to stay tied my recommendation is to buy socks that are really snug around your ankles and use a different pair of laces besides that I think the shoes are really cute love the choice of brown and blue I think they work well together also the shoe has pretty good support I use my own inserts which fit well in the shoe but like I said if you dont the original inserts are pretty good I bought these as a birthday present for myself I originally wanted to use them as my new jogging shoes The tongue of the shoe is just too stiff for that though I am still happy with the shoes cuz they are super cute Besides the stiff tongue my only other complaint is they seem a tad larger than my other size tens I have a little more space than I like to have Otherwise completely awesome I was so excited to find these shoes They are super cute  They were too small however and I cannot find the larger size I need  When I tried them on they were really stiff and a bit tight  Who knows maybe they would stretch out as I wore them but they just didnt fit  I am disappointed that I cant find the size I need anywhere but will keep looking Its a very comfortable and lightweight shoe  I found it to be pretty true for a size 10 but all shoes run differently  Other reviews said it ran small but I didnt find that the case I bought the 10D width  The wider width doesnt look odd it fits the shoe well and my foot Two years ago I bought this same exact shoes  I wore them always when choosing a stylish athletic shoe Originally I bought them when our family was going to go to The Ark in Kentucky and knew we would be doing alot of walkingthere has never been a time that my feet hurt when I wear these shoes And I get compliments often as to how cute they look  So best shoes for me for comfort and style Bought them again to update and bought an additional pair in black An sich wunderschÃ¶ner Schuh auspacken und direkt meinem Kind angezogen Das Kind geht 2 Schritte und fÃ¤ngt bitterlich an zu weinen Sofort Schuhe ausgezogen und mal geschaut was da los ist Es war nen fÃ¼r Kleinkinderschuhe wirklich groÃ\\x9fer Knick in der Inneneinlage der sich auch nicht wirklich begradigen lÃ¤sst Bedauerlich wo doch der Schuh an sich nicht im Discounter Sektor liegt Da hÃ¤tte ich wirklich mehr erwartet Auf einem der Fotos steht auf der Sohle die gr 26Die Schuhe die mit verschickt wurden ist die Gr 19Habe keine Antwort auf meine Frage vor einigen  Tagen bekommen welche GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe das tatsÃ¤chlich ist Grandson couldnt even get them on they are so tightly cut The laces broke after slightly over one week of use Horrible quality Before it broke my son complained it was very uncomfortable as the metal grommets on the sides rub against the side of his foot Nice pair of shoes These shoes are cute and jus fine I wanted to comment on the company actually I bought these for a wedding for my son to wear and they werenâ\\x80\\x99t going to arrive in time  I reached out to Amazon with no luck I finally contacted the company directly and they said they didnâ\\x80\\x99t think they could get them to me in time because of how the process works However I literally received these the very next day Whoever I spoke to thank you you obviously went out of your way to get these pulled and shipped to me and I canâ\\x80\\x99t thank you enough They made it on time and the wedding was gorgeousMy son kept the shoes on all night and now wears them when he wants to dress up casual  he says they are comfy and shoe laces are long enough he can tie them easily When my 8 year old asked for â\\x80\\x9cskate shoesâ\\x80\\x9d I could only picture AirWalks or Vans which are cute but donâ\\x80\\x99t fit their wide feet well I began searching and found these They are not just skate shoes but also adorable and good Adidas quality Great looking shoe at a great price I got these in the gray with black stripes and the black with white stripes Looks exactly like the ones I got from the store that were 20 more They run big I wear a womenâ\\x80\\x99s 7 in most shoes I measured my foot on the big kids Adidas size chart and according to it I should get a 65 I got the 6 because they didnâ\\x80\\x99t have any other sizes and based on other reviews from women I was hoping they would work out Theyâ\\x80\\x99re big I measured them against the

a 5 if they were available Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to guess with the weird sizing situation Hopefully putting in some insoles will help because I want to keep them Very nice shoes Got them when they were on sale and they are really nice The shoes fit as expected I bought these for my seven year old son He loves how comfortable they are Definitely worth the buy Kid loves them Good fit and comfortable These shoes fit well and are comfortable My son likes it However he said its heavy Other than that its a great shoe Brought these for my grandson  and Im told it fits him perfectly and he loves them

Eigentlich ein ganz toller und bequemer Schuh von Superfit Ich weiÃ\\x9f nicht warum der Hersteller die Sohle so billig hergestellt hat Nach ein paar mal anziehen ging die weiÃ\\x9fe Schukappe schon ab Sollte bei teuren Markenschuhen ein NoGo sein Komfort und perfekt schucse Ein wunderschÃ¶ner Lederschuh der allerdings deutlich schmÃ¤ler ausfÃ¤llt Eigentlich trÃ¤gt unser Sohn die mittlere Breite hier handelt es sich eher um die schmale AusfÃ¼hrung Daher ging der Schuh leider retour Sehr ungewÃ¶hnlich fÃ¼r Superfit Unser Tochter 20 M zieht diese Schuhe sehr gerne an und lÃ¤uft damit auch gerne herumAbgesehen davon ist FarbeModell sehr schÃ¶n Beste Schuhe von Superfit generell Wir sind immer zufrieden und dieser Schuh gefÃ¤llt mir persÃ¶nlich sehr gut Super hochwertiger Kinderschuh Meine Tochter fÃ¤hrt voll darauf ab Muy cÃ³modo para el NiÃ±o Itâ\\x80\\x99s a tight fit The top part doesnâ\\x80\\x99t open so it made  it super hard for my son to get the shoe on We ended up returning the shoes If Puma will make it so that the top part can open and then possible Velcro closed or maybe zipper it would be awesome so kids can easily slide their feet in This product fits well but may not be ideal for a child that has wide feet The strap across the top has some stretch but it is very thick and does not stretch easily which may make it difficult for a wider foot to get pass that section The entire shoe is made very well Difficult to put on They are too hard Son loves them and is willing to double up in sock layers to make fit Would recommend going a half size down My son is 45 big kids by size measurements but could easily have fit for a long while in a 4 My Grandson loves his Pumas and so do I â\\x9d£ï¸\\x8f No complains Muy lindos pero aprietan de la parte de Arriba I order  a size 11 kids size shoes received  and 10 its very tight on my child foot elastic  that run across cant expands  sorry I every purchased  this damn shoes Producto original de buena calidad Talla justa CumpliÃ³ las expectativas Mein 4 jÃ¤hriger Sohn liebt diese Stiefel und mÃ¶chte seine anderen Schuhe nicht mehr tragen Er hat in den Stiefeln keine SchweiÃ\\x9ffÃ¼Ã\\x9fe wie in einigen anderen Schuhen Er lÃ¤uft sehr gut  darin und hat auch bei eisigen Temperaturen keine kalten FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe Die Stiefel sind meiner Meinung nach von einer sehr guten QualitÃ¤t und deshalb etwas schwerer Meinen Sohn stÃ¶rt das Ã¼berhaupt nicht Er kommt perfekt rein und wieder raus das war bei anderen Stiefeln problematischer Das Highlight fÃ¼r ihn ist natÃ¼rlich das blinken Ich werde die Stiefel auch wohl im nÃ¤chsten Winter kaufen Beck Gummistiefel begleiten uns nun schon einige Jahre Passform super vorallem wenn die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe etwas breiter geschnitten sind Klare Kaufempfehlung Die Leuchtfunktion beim Gehen ein Highlight fÃ¼r die Kleinen Schuhe halten die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe im Herbst und Winter schÃ¶n warm Wir haben dieses Modell schon das zweite Jahr im Einsatz Habe die Gummistiefel fÃ¼r meine beiden Kinder gekauft Und sie wurden ausgiebig im Urlaub am Strand und in PfÃ¼tzen getestet Die Gummistiefel haben den Test bestanden und bekommen 5 Sterneâ\\x98\\x85 entsprechen der angegebene GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe genug Platz auch mit dicken Sockenâ\\x98\\x85 Wasserdichtâ\\x98\\x85 halten kleine FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe warm und trockenâ\\x98\\x85 schÃ¶nes Designâ\\x98\\x85 blinkende Sohle sehr gut sichtbar im dunkelnKann diese Stiefel nur empfehlen ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Ich habe diese Gummistiefel nun das zweite Mal bestellt aus den ersten ist mein SÃ¶hnchen herausgewachsen Die Gummistiefel sind sehr robust Sie haben ein ganzes Kindergartenjahr vergleichsweise gut Ã¼berstanden Sie halten warm und trocken Es stimmt dass die Stiefel etwas schwerer sind als andere Gummistiefel aber meinen Sohn hat das nicht gestÃ¶rt oder beim Laufen behindert Ein paar kleine Kritikpunkte Die Blinkfunktion hat im Laufe des Jahres den Geist aufgegeben auch riechen die Stiefel leicht nach Chemie wenn sie noch ganz neu sind Die Gummistiefel sind sehr schÃ¶n verarbeitet und unser Sohn liebt sie Nebst der guten Verarbeitung ist der Leuchteffekt sehr ansprechend und unser Sohn ist gut zu sehen Der Leuchteffekt bleibt auch bei starker Verschmutzung bestehen und die Schuhe lassen sich sehr gut reinigen Mein Sohn ist sehr zufrieden Die Stiefel sind gut verarbeitet und halten im Winter die FÃ¼sse schÃ¶n trocken und warm Sie sind von innen vollstÃ¤ndig mit einem kuscheligen Kunstfell gefÃ¼ttert und von auÃ\\x9fen im ganzen mit durchsichtigem Gummi Ã¼berzogen Das Dinosaurierskelettmuster ist schÃ¶n und perfekt fÃ¼r alle Dinofans Die Ferse blinkt beim gehen was im dunklen Winter nur vom Vorteil sein kann Der Stiefel fÃ¤llt etwas groÃ\\x9f aus Sollte vielleicht lieber eine GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe kleiner bestellt werden Alles im ganzen ein guter Wintergummistiefel zum relativ gÃ¼nstigen Preis Sohnemann brauchte neue Gummistiefel und diese fand er optisch sehr schÃ¶n also bestelltLeider passten die ersten nicht weshalb wir sie dann nochmal grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt habenEr ist jetzt sehr zufrieden sie blinken halten trockenbund sind innen auch noch etwas flauschig und daher etwas wÃ¤rmer als andere Stiefel Resistentes no entra agua los dÃ\\xadas de lluvia y con un diseÃ±o informal que tanto sirve para llevar con uniforme al colegio o para unos vaqueros en fin de semana Perfectos Die Stiefel sehen schÃ¶n aus und die Blinklichter funktionieren einwandfrei Allerdings sind die Stiefel schon ziemlich schwer und scheinen von der Passform nicht besonders gut zu sein Mein Sohn hat es nach zwei Versuchen sein lassen da er keinen guten halt hatte und somit nicht bequem damit laufen konnte Very nice boots I had hoped the shoe laces would be flexible and integrated like most Camper shoes Here you get regular laces and as such you dont get the Camper feeling or practicality of putting them on and off quickly They are quite light which is a plus die Lieferung kam sehr schnell und gut verpackt bei mir andie Schuhe sind wie in den Angaben beschriebenmein Kind hat sich sehr gefreutich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Preis und der QualitÃ¤t Suuuuper bequeme Schuhe mein Mann sagt er lÃ¤uft wie auf WolkenPassen perfekt

Muy cÃ³modos para trote o caminatas los recomiendo The shoe is responsive and that is good But it would be better to have longer shoe laces love my running shoes These were waaaay smaller than the size they were supposed to beCute shoes thoi bought them for my 6 yr old but they fit my 4 yr oldsoif you order themget them 2 sizes bigger than you usually would get My daughter was size 7 I ordered a size 9 they were still very tight Id say size up 10 they would fit perfectly They super cute otherwise 4 stars for sizing issue Not true to size at all They run very small But after return and requesting 3 sizes bigger we are pleased The shoes are cute in person than in pic Honestly look way better in person does not look super cheap in the bowl detail is very decent real cute but ran small loved the look but had to return To small for my granddaughter Runs smaller than the actual size Very cute but they run small Returned it Ordered a size 6 Looked like size 3 Was very small Not very good quality They were extremely small not true to her size at all Pretty but no good if it donâ\\x80\\x99t fit So comfortable Soft white leather True to size authentic product Amazing value super soft leather and incredibly comfortable and lightweight Very poor leather quality The sneakers are very cute and elegant but have been sitting in my closet for the past months I donâ\\x80\\x99t see myself wearing them again I wore them for a couple of weeks and they got soiled as all shoes do When I tried to clean them with a damp cloth which I always do with my soiled leather shoes I got a discoloration as a result that was even bigger than the initial spot and nothing can be done about it It cannot be fixed Unfortunately a waste of money Not leather inside or out Really smelly polyurethane smell too Got them for 2300 so Im keeping them No wonder one of the reviewers stated that they didnt last This shoe is a bit too tight and the leather shoelaces shed little pieces of leather They did include a second pair of cotton laces which is odd Super cute shoes The leather laces are just ridiculous because they shed everywhere but they send regular laces to change them out need to put in an insole that supports a foot I dont like wearing flat shoes so I put my own in The top of the shoe rubbed really bad on my right foot large toe joint which is my good foot My left foot with having had major surgeries didnt have same issue So I am still healing from 2 bad blisters on the right toe joint a week ago Great quality leather narrow fit but length is true to size Theyre in new condition but came in tissue in an amazon box no frye box the laces seem really long and thick for the shoes but overall theyre super cute and a great way to dress up sneakers I bought these shoes despite the price tag of 140 because they were exactly my style and when I got them I indeed loved the look however the first day I wore the shoes only for 2 hours I got a blister the size of a quarter that have caused me to loose sleep for two days do to pain If shoes are that pricy there is no reason why they shouldnt be built with comfort or at the very least not cause this amount of pain  Great fit but the sole is totally flat and hard offering very little traction Odd being able to accidentally slide while wearing a tennis shoe Thick suede laces are not easy to use Sehr schÃ¶ner Schuh zum gÃ¼nstigen Preis Diese Gummistiefel sind im Vergleich zu vielen anderen alternativ bestellten sehr bequem nicht so eng geschnitten am FuÃ\\x9f sie haben eine biegsame Sohle und sind vorallem geruchsarmKann ich nur weiterempfehlen Die Stiefel sind von ganz guter QualitÃ¤t sehen hÃ¼bsch aus und sind wohl lt meiner Tochter auch bequem Meine Tochter zieht sie gerne an Sie fallen allerdings etwas kleiner aus Ã\\x9cberrascht sind sÃ¼Ã\\x9fe weiche Gummistiefel QualitÃ¤t ist gut und wie erwartetGerne empfehle ich weiter Meine Tochter liebt diese Gummistiefel PreisLeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis stimmt Preis  Leistung in Ordnung Bardzo Å\\x82adne i wygodne Super Passform Great shoes for kids The pink is actually nicer in real life than photos I bought these  June 15 The shoes are either defective or counterfeit itâ\\x80\\x99s now July 21 The return window closed 7 days agoand unfortunately these tennis shoes created a hole where my toe is I wore them approximately one hour per day and not every day throughout the month Iâ\\x80\\x99ve bought new balance even this same style  for years and never had this happen within the first month Theyâ\\x80\\x99re either defective in which case Iâ\\x80\\x99d like the manufacturer or seller to return them and replace with a new pair or theyâ\\x80\\x99re counterfeit and not made well Iâ\\x80\\x99m hoping Amazon or the seller will get in touch with me so we can rectify the situation Thank you My son is flatfooted with an overpronation problem These shoes have helped stabilize that Plus he is really rough on shoes but these hold up ok By the time he grows out of them they are pretty demolished but they last long enough for us These shoes wore out quickly Fewer than 3 months and they have a big hole and the soles are separating from the shoe We bought New Balance from the local NB store and they lasted 7 months These were disappointing my kid has very wide feet so sizing is always difficult but these fit true to size in XW I ordered 4 pairs NB all in different models in xw and by far he says these have the best cushioning and support only wish they had more colors I bought these for my 9yo in a size 7 I came on here and saw a great deal I got these for 18 It had to be a mistake My daughter loves them and says she never wants to take them off they are so comfortable Mom it feels like Iâ\\x80\\x99m walking on clouds Just under 2two months and both left and right soles have split apart Will never purchase these models of NB Never had any other issues with the other models Buy at your own risk and NOT recommend these shoes for the kiddos I purchased these for my daughter in June  By the time school started in August they had holes in them  Keep in mind my daughter was wearing flip flops most of the summer not tennis shoes These were not worth the money for less than two months of wear I bought a pair for daily walking and running 55 in big kid as Im a size 7 in women  Ive yet to experience any pain in my feet I needed a pair of shoes to support my flat feet and the these definitely do the job The arches are wonderful on my feet and the shoes are light Theyre breathable and super bright Ive gotten many compliments I plan on purchasing another pair before they run out Good looking shoe The previous pair we had of this same shoe lasted for almost a year on a boy who is really rough on shoes Runs a little large Great for kids who tend to walk on the insides of their feet Nice color combination Very comfortable and perfect fit I bought this colour because it was half the price of the other colour options and I wanted the shoe for outside work so colour was of less concern I like the colour and am wearing these shoes much more than I expected to Excellent value Im wearing them now  Therere very light BUT very strong  Im not quite sure about this but Im pretty sure that on a wet floor theyre more stable when I put weight on them  I simply dont want to know WITHOUT A DOUBT because I dont want to get my insurance involved  Excellent Very comfortable and the color is accurate Love it I have nothing bad to say about it Confy expectrd size nice color These super cute casual sneaker that are pretty comfy I personally would prefer a bit more arch support but they are still comfy for casual wear  They look cute with shorts jean and casual dresses  I love the little gold details like eyelets and on the end of the shoe strings These are easily the worst shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever owned I love the print but they are so uncomfortable There is padding in the bottom and the back of the shoe but the back of the shoe pinches my heel I did buy gel inserts to put in the back of the shoe and they donâ\\x80\\x99t help I was hoping that the problem would get better once they were broken in but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve worn them almost daily for 2 weeks and itâ\\x80\\x99s not I will not be buying another pair of Keds These are so cute but I had to return them as they were way too stiff and would have caused blisters on my heels for sure I had red marks just from trying them on Super bummed because they are so cute I love these shoes They are so comfortable Very cute Beautiful and comfortable pair of shoes I absolutely am obsessed with these Very cute but horribly uncomfortable and strange sizing Narrow in toe area but long and stiff rubs heel Returning I love Keds they are one of my favorites shoes I especially luv the cheetah print that is also my favorite Perfect Fit  Look Great So Comfortable Sind soweit zufriedenSchuh ist einfach schick mit den BlÃ¼mchen darauf und die

Eigentlich hat meine Tochter grad 3031 Die letzten Schuh waren in 31 aber sind ihr jetzt zu klein Habe die 32 u 33 bestellt Man kann die Innensohle rausnehmen und da sieht man das die 33 genau richtig

Wenn ihr sie bestellt empfehle ich 12 Nummern kleiner Muy buena mi hija de 4 aÃ±os las usa para la gimnasia del cole y despuÃ©s de un aÃ±o de trote aÃºn estÃ¡n perfectas Me ha gustado Ã©sta marca repetirÃ© Die Schuhe sind sehr schick En un par de meses las puntas de las zapatillas ya estaban despegadas y en unos meses mÃ¡s tienen un aspecto lamentable These are great minus the fact the tongue is sewn to the insides of the shoemaybe that is a thing they do to cleats but my first experience and makes a little difficult to get on but upside doesnâ\\x80\\x99t come off easy either when untied So otherwise 5star would have been given The opening for the shoe is fixed It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t stretch and the opening is small So unless you have an extremely petit ankle and foot area then these are nearly impossible to put on  My 9 year old who is petite couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even get these on after trying a second pair a size larger  Disheartening considering Adidas cleats are our normal goto Daughter loved them Fit was great and they look great too Daughter is 12 Shoes fit perfect You have to break them in though Overall great fit and great look No more blisters I wear a size 9 12 fits perfect Too small I want to return them for a pair that fit comfortably Have two bloody blisters now My wife recently used these every day on our cruise and found them to be excellent for dancing  They are pretty good looking too First pair I ordered was too large but these fit perfectly I normally take a 11 12 but a 11 was too large 10 fits nicely They are very nice sandals at a very reasonable price  Very fast shipping I ordered them just before noon on Thursday and they arrived Friday  WoW After I tried them on I then bought a different type because the insole has a ridge on one side that feels uncomfortableThe different ones I bought next â\\x80\\x94 DenverHayes Quad Comfort â\\x80\\x94 feel amazing Yes my husband was thrilled with his new Sandals They fit very good and he was happy with the colour choice Fue un regalo para mi papÃ¡ y le quedaron muy bien CÃ³modas y frescas Los pedÃ\\xad para mi novio Ã©l es 7 en MÃ©xico y los que pedÃ\\xad de acuerdo a la conversiÃ³n

Very comfortable Would buy again As ordered Wish someone would make them out of leather Would have given 5 stars if had leather uppers The quality is not good A bit biggerThe foam will sunk in and your feet will feel the bottomDue to a bit oversize when walking the area near the toe cap is rubbing my toes El producto es de una excelente calidad es muy amblio y recuerden que si lo usan sin

COMODOS QUEDAN COMO UN GUANTE LA TALLA EXACTA ME ENCANTARON I read many reviews before I bought these Since so many people said they run big and my last pair of adidas cloudfoam were pretty big I went half a size down I usually wear 85 so I ordered an 8 They were a little tight the first couple times I wore them so I would advise just ordering them in your regular size Luckily theyve stretched out a bit so my foot fits in there perfectly now I just have to wear thin socks The shoes are super light weight Ive used them for the gym and for running errands Only thing I dont like is that the bottom of the shoe is too smooth Id be scared to wear these on a rainy day Al mes se daÃ±oNo es buena calidad Nice tough shoe for my play hard grandson to wear with his school uniform Heâ\\x80\\x99s hard on

brand shoe shoes are confy tho and seem durable Awesome  Great shoe for the gym and skipping I ordered half size bigger like recommended an they work perfect  I wouldnt run in them but they are nice and flat and work great for squats and deadlift Good value for the money Quality looks good however It was small in size Return to vendor Great fit and feel would recommend this shoes It is a really good pair of wrestling boots I would recommend these for starters Great shoe but a bit narrow Good shoes Brought as a work boot but I did not like the height of the heel so returning for refund Good boot just a little larger than expected as I ordered a little big thinking that actual size would be too small returned for a little smaller size Thank ya kindly sir This is my 2nd pair  love them  love them  love them Be Blessed Ive been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality I usually plan on buying a pair every year I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material rubber plastic polyblablabla whatever It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather I did try them on and they just didnt feel the same The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit With a history of plantar fasciitus I just cant take the chance of wearing low quality footwear Sorry Dan post I gotta move on I bought these with apprehension having Spine issues and a Spinal Implant Device for Pain I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought Iâ\\x80\\x99d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot Justin has Issues now for some reason I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever put on my Feet I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot thatâ\\x80\\x99s unheard of and if youâ\\x80\\x99re a Boot Person you know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m talking about some discomfort is expected with new Boots I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 12 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed Iâ\\x80\\x99m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and Iâ\\x80\\x99m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot I canâ\\x80\\x99t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion I did have to put in an Insole due to my Right Boot missing one but it didnâ\\x80\\x99t matter these are just a quality Comfortable BootSemper Fidelis These are comfortable and cushy in the foot The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes to open the toe area for a better fit  I wear a womens 85 and the mens size 7 fit well w an added 34 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support These would be great for winter with the sturdy rubber soles with tread and warm lining But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these so that I kept rocking back on the heels  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing and I was constantly rocking back on the heelsI think this was a defect so returned them I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper brushed or suede type leather  in the past they were made with a smooth leather so the boots are no longer an oily brown as described but more a reddish brown suede  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on and I was not nuts about that One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede Boot manufacturers are swapping out this nappy brushed leather or suede for real smooth leather on many boots bc it must be cheaper Sad bc the smooth leather looks better and wears longer I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try  Perhaps a boot horn would help butanyway great boots if you can get them on Very comfortable  Not sure what to do at this pointSo I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair  They sent out a new pair This is an entirely different boot  They are at least 12 too small  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom The sole is 12 narrower  The Dan Post Tag is a different color green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original  The heal seems higher  Leather is inferior Weird  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes  Looks like Im just going to get my money back  Too bad Ive owned over 10 pairs of Dan Post boots Yes Im a big fan of them I enjoy wearing Westernstyled clothes and boots Im also a truck driver and a biker These boots fit the bill for all of these Right out of the box they look great and are very comfortable I wear a 12D I ordered a 12D and the fit is spot on No problems at the heel arch or toe Theyre listed as Waterproof Havent put that to the test yet Theyre not as heavy as I thought theyd be Very nice boot easy to get used to and looks great I gave them a good treatment of Leather Honey to condition the leather and give them some extra protection All in all a great boot I have no issues with them Theyre Dan Post bootsgreat boots great quality and great looks As I titled this review if youre considering these boots buy them A great all around boot Lastly Ive read reviews mentioning that theyre made in China Yes unfortunately mine say it too Really sad Ive owned these boots for two years and have worn them nearly every day  From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain these boots have done all Ive asked and more  In fact theyre still going and I cant stand not wear them because theyre incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apartIve given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for meThe only time I dont wear these boots is when Im workingout or Im hiking  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the fieldProsThe fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out Thats the only weak point and I think its the piping that causes the failure Muy bonitos Le gustaron mucho a mi hija Vienen mÃ¡s grandes pero siempre compro una talla menos en esta marca Los recomiendo The shoes themselves are super cute but the box came trashed I wouldnt say it was beat up during transit either I was disappointed because they are a gift Cute shoes but started to stink with her not wearing socks after only a few wears Very disappointed leider viel zu groÃ\\x9f ging zurÃ¼ck kulante RÃ¼ckname gute Abwicklung Ich trage Rolling Soft Schuhe von Gabor gerne und bin bis jetzt noch nie enttÃ¤uscht worden Schuhe passen wie erwartet ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Passen perfekt Me ha gustado la rapidez de la entrega They look great on her feet Really nice shoe And has withstood the whole summer without looking so beat up Lol These shoes fit my daughter as hoped and they are SUPER cute However the zippers on the back are unbelievably hard to zip and unzip I would much rather have bought her shoes that she can put on and take off without needing assistance These sandals are adorable They fit just as expected Probably not the best shoe for wider feet though as theyâ\\x80\\x99re pretty skinny but work just fine for my step daughter The back is a little hard to zip up and down but Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure itâ\\x80\\x99ll be easier in time Definitely would buy again I bought these for my 4 year old She absolutely loves them She wears them every chance she gets and they dont show a lot of wear and tear They look great with shorts or a skirtdress So fashionable Well crafted My goodness do we struggle to zip these things upThey are much wider than anticipatedMeh Cutest shoes ever Exactly as described but cuter in person They fit according to size Came in a box from Kmart which was really nice super cute and well packaged Has not tried them on yet but will love them Lovely slipperI accidentally ordered wrong sizeIm too far to return Great buy These shoes were packaged like they cost 100 Cans in a lovely reusable bag a bracelet and a thank you card Very nice Highly recommended Thought I would love these I didnt open them right away so I did a few days ago only to find that they fit about half a size big and they feel like theyre a wide width Then I notice that the eyelets on the left shoe dont line up so when I tied it up it made it feel weird I dont usually complain but the price of these was too much for what I received Excuse my fat ankles in the pictureð\\x9f\\x98\\x81ð\\x9f\\x98¬ But these are so very comfortable And they are very lightweight toonot real heavy like some shoes are Ive been looking pretty much everywhere for a comfortable pair of shoes to do some walking in and these are just right Theyre also easy to slip on without having to use your fingers to help with getting them on I love them and may get another pair in a different color ð\\x9f\\x8e¨ The shoe is stylish and comfortable Please do not listen to previous review on sizing up  I did and regret it I wear size 8 ordered 8 12 and now a little too big  Order your right size and you will be happy with this product The shoe is a bit narrower than I expected They have good heel comfort but no arch support Love it comfortable and light weight buy them for work They look great and feel good Muy cÃ³modos y los nÃºmeros son exactos Comfortable Size was correct Muy cÃ³modo me gustan Ho acquistato queste scarpe perchÃ© catturato dal design moderno e accattivanteI materiali costruttivi sembrano abbastanza buoni il mix tra pelle e tessuto stile camouflage sulla parte posteriore rende particolare la scarpaSono provviste di una zip laterale che permette di indossarle facilmente la vestibilitÃ\\xa0 Ã¨ conforme alla solita taglia che indosso per altri modelli di scarpe e sono comode da calzare Sieht gut aus hÃ¤lt ohne Innenfutter

immer eine Nr grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer hier aber nicht erforderlich Verarbeitung und QualitÃ¤t top Modern und passen genau Bonitos y cÃ³modos porque estÃ¡n anchos pero se despegaron muy pronto TenÃ\\xada mejores expectativas de esta marca y en esta ocasiÃ³n no duraron Bonito a la vista pero de muy mala calidad se despegaron al mes de uso ambos tenis de toda la parte delantera parecÃ\\xada una buena oferta pero salÃ\\xad perdiendo Fue un regalo para una prima muy bonito a la vista por los colores esos colores morados le gustaron mucho y son comodos  me comenta Muy bonitos lastima que llegaron sÃºper grandes en realidad no son 23 cm EstÃ¡n precioosos aunque son tenis idealmente para niÃ±os se los regale a mi hermana de 34 aÃ±os y le quedaron a la perfecciÃ³n  Estoy muy contento con la compra me gustan los tens para mi hij gracias Bonitos De muy buena calidad Hermosos en verdad Bien NÃºmero exacto Me gustÃ³ bien sellado original They sent the wrong size product description was misleading Buenos un poco pequeÃ±os Like the shoesreceived within 2 days I have worn New Balance shoes for 10 years now  I started with New Balance WX1011 and WX1012 Cross trainers for tennis based on recommendation from my local New Balance specialty shop  WX 1011 and 1012 were light weight mesh flexible with good lateral support and soles that were not too stiff  As a replacement shoe New Balance recommended this 966v3 shoe This is one of the most uncomfortable shoes I have tried on  It is stiff it presses across the toes and causes pain and the soles are too thick and stiff for quick movement on the tennis court Comfortable fit except for the area at the top lace hole It is very stiff and rests on the inner ankle bone which causes rubbing and discomfort Tried tieing at a lower hole but still rubs Once I figure out how to alleviate this problem I will be happy Hope in time it will loosen up As mentioned by others these shoes not only run small but they pinch in the forefoot Also the fit and finish of these shoes is highly disappointing   the way the tongue is sewn into the shoe leaves a lot to be desired and the extra fabric inside the shoe rubs your feet Finally the plastic edge where the lace holes sit is extremely rigid and this same plastic edge also affects the front of your foot when tiedAm definitely returning and looking for a better solution These are very uncomfortable sneakers  I bought them a while  ago and thought they just needed more time to break in  Months later still feel stiff heavy and has some plastic pieces that dig in some spots  Will have to get rid of these I loved the colors but sizing runs small I wear a size 11 normally and was trying to find a wider pair of shoes These are very tight on my foot and Iâ\\x80\\x99m hoping they stretch out a bit when worn in When I ordered these the website said 65 Medium but at checkout it said 65 D I called Amazon  they said these were 65 Medium They arrived  the box said 65 D Thatâ\\x80\\x99s too wide for me so I returned them I have other New Balance tennis shoes that are 65B Iâ\\x80\\x99m grateful shipping  return were free Nice looking shoe Still battle with fit Also the black is glittering which looks strange NO arch support it is not original product Replica of New Balance shoeI really wonder and so very about India why this much cheating and corruption happening IndiaI can see some places of shoe no stitches Some place of shoe not sticked with glue very very very pooor product New balance is a recognized brand for sports shoes this particular shoe is branded as running shoes I had purchased this shoe in 18 Dec 2020  I am not able to use it anymore due to the damage to the heel area Within 2 months of use the area near my toe got damaged  I had to get leather patch glued to it from inside to prevent further damage clearly visible on both shoesWithin 4 months heel support area got worn out refer picture causing pain in heelFor the price this shoe should have lasted 2 years but it did not last 4 monthsI run  walk average of 5 to 8 km daily normally my shoes last over 5 years but I was expecting this shoe to last at least 2 years The got this shoe for just 1100 however the quality was not very good and fitting was also very tight The inside sole and upper of shoe doesnt feel to be of high quality and looks like it wont last longer than 34 months After seeing the shoe i returned it and would not recommend you to buy this particular shoe from New Balance You get what u pay for Decent for the price Very basic shoe If you want a neutral shoe which u can use for commute as sneaker and use it for ocassional short distance run then it might suit u Cushioning is provided by fresh foam which is decent but not as plush Not much of a tech goes into it Like it doesnt have hard plate in mid sole which keeps ur midfoot stable or say solid heel lock is missing No extra layers of protection in terms of cushioning in the sole Laces are just basic Build quality is ok but not great Not suitable for broad feet Decent but I think Asics Gel Nimbus and Mizuno Waverider are miles ahead of it in terms of neutral road running shoe Waverider 19 is still the most value for money product here in India Gel Nimbus are bit expensive If u still wanna stuck with NB better look for Fresh Foam 1080 V or 880 V Fitting is perfect i have ordered one size up Light weight but the sole and quality of the product is good Thanks amazon for the surprising offer i am glad that i got this pair at a comparatively low price for this quality productbest for walking and running it looks very stylish we can use them as the casual wear too After all it is NB it would fit for any duty InitiallyI was fooled by description that product need to be bought one size largerBut eventually 9 UK is 95 US soBuy ur own sizeRan 5 km with it on first dayComfortable1000 skipping in one goComfortableOnly one test leftHOW LONG IT LASTGood product estan hermosos y la gamusa es muy suave y se ven increibles muy muy comodos y color y precio excelente lo malo es que con el paso del tiempo se ensucian mucho hay que tener cuidado con este tipo de tenis Vender un zapato tamaÃ±o wide sin aclararlo me parece un engaÃ±o Era para deshacerse de sus saldos MÃ\\xadnimo ofrezcan un precio acorde en todo casoEl tenis serÃ\\xada excelente si su tamaÃ±o fuese normal Got these in 12 4E as I have large feet Usually new balance fits me properly in 6E but I thought I would give these a try to see Man these are made SMALL Another pair of New Balance which I bought at the same time fit decently these would not even get on my foot Padrisimos y muy cÃ³modoPara correr soy mÃ¡s rÃ¡pidoCon estos tenis los siento muy ligeros y en carreras de 5 a 10 km me funcionan muy bien Sehr schÃ¶ner brauner Sneaker Passt sehr gut und sieht nicht zu groÃ\\x9f aus Kann den Schuh nur weiter empfehlen sieht sogar in echt besser aus die Farbe als auf jedem Foto WÃ¼rde ich wieder kaufen PreisLeistungsVerhÃ¤ltnis ist TOP Ganz schickweich und bequem Easy anzuziehen durch den seitlichen ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss Guter Preis nan Son unos tenis muy bonitos tuve que compramos de nuevo en una tienda por quÃ© no me llegaron los que yo pedÃ\\xad y tuve que devolverlos y decidÃ\\xad buscarlos en una tienda Adidas y al probÃ¡rmelos me di cuanta que estaban muy duros no sentÃ\\xad al boots como le mencionan que son muy cÃ³modos en verdad pagar mÃ¡s de 2000 pesos por unos tenis con poco confort no vale la pena solo te venden la vista de unos tenis pero no los recomiendo Muy cÃ³modos Excelente compra De lo mejor que he tenido adidasA considerar que siendo de tela se ensucian muy rapido y no es fÃ¡cil limpiarlos Great solid shoe Tight around the heelAchilles initially but gets better after some wear I have a very high arch and the shoes take the pressure and pain away when I play tennis This is my second pair in two years and I love them They were way too thin on my feet Maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s just this color way but the fit is TERRIBLE Itâ\\x80\\x99s tight midfoot because of some band on the top but itâ\\x80\\x99s actually loose in the toe box When shoes fit this bad I just can not recommend them for anything Not for basketball not for working out not even for walking Adidas is a great brand but they made a mistake with these shoes I can only see them working if you have overly narrow feet and you size down them First these are good looking shoes they fit pretty well and the sole has pretty good grip  What is extremely disappointing is the cushioning level  What you see on the side of the shoe is not at all what is actually in the sole cushion  I was looking forward to the Boost cushioning  Instead what you get appears to be less than a 14 inch of cushioning  After playing a few games on a hard court my knees were extremely sore  All the cushioning you see around the heel is window dressing  I would not recommend to anyone who values their joints These shoes are awesome and are my new favorites The Adidas boost on these are the best cushion Ive ever felt to date They feel really good when walking or running because you can feel the energy returned to your feet from the boost cushion I want these shoes in a couple of different colorways and the 34 or high top versions I like the various different textilestextures The thick collar around the ankle  achilles looks kinda weird but Im used to it  like it now Kudos to the design team I would love to see how this shoe was made  put together

have a narrow foot I would advise against them gots no soulgrip too slick on indoor courts after only 45 wears  The cushioning is pretty decent but shoes are worthless due to the slickness  Adidas support was no help other than to suggest giving to a friend Im offering it to my enemies instead  Going back to Nike Son super cÃ³modos y bonitos no vienen amplios asi que pidan pantalla correcta en

New Balance shoes run a little small My normal running shoes are Asics Gel Kayano 115 4E width That is my absolute standard when it comes to fit and feelWhen I usually purchase New Balance shoes I get size 12 4E Even then its can be slightly short but tolerable  With these shoes I started with the 12 4E But man do they run long The width seemed to be pretty accurate thoughSo I went with the 115 4E instead They fit almost perfectly except MAYBE a little long in the toes However I believe it were a size down it would be a little too shortThese are absolutely awesome on outdoor pickleball courts Ive easily put on about 20 hours of play on them and they barely have any wear I HIGHLY recommend and love them so much I actually have a 2nd pair as backup New Balance shoes are the only shoes I wear  I own about 15 pair  Always 8 12 to 9D  This is much narrower than all my other shoes right about where the arch is  New Balance really screwed up here  Long time buyers used to be able to find the newer model of a pair of shoes that they like but not any more  I wish somebody at New Balance would listen to their customers I wore 1004 4e 1005 4e Once NB made the 1006 the toe width got narrow I figured Iâ\\x80\\x99d try these and they were comfortable for a 3 hour match I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how durable they will be but for now they were worth the money Iâ\\x80\\x99m editing because after 6 weeks these shoes are not durable I play ALOT of pickleball and platform tennis Both are tough on shoes Time will tell about the durability But from a fit weight and mobility standpoint  these IMO are best in class Ive tried several major brands and the umpteen different models they offer I even tried other New Balance models All were either too rigid too loose heavy etc Thank goodness for amazons return policy Not mentioned they look good too Attractive style but too narrow and low for my wide high instep hammer toed feet They killed my hammer toe New Balance is my go to for racquetball and walking sneakers but these are narrower and lower at the toe than the 608s I uaually wear Should have returned but kept past the return limit trying to break them in My bad These tennis shoes are working very well It gives me the advantage I was looking for I purchased these sneakers in late July  I have worn them a hand full of times and noted a very foul odor after each use  I have always played sports and have never had this problem with any other court shoes in the past  Because I have gone over the return window I am forced to throw these shoes away and buy a different pair  I am so disappointed I paid over 8400 for these sneakers So far so good Iâ\\x80\\x99ve only played on them a few times but the fit is good the cushioning is good and they look great Feel apart in less than a month of play Einfache Halleschuche gute preis  gute Leistung  aber form ein bisschen klein bestellen sie 1 Nummer grosse Katastrophe Pumas come small and narrow but overall design appears good I dont recommend first day After measuring my foot following the size chart and ordering a 7 I could barely fit my foot in the shoe Turns out I have an incredibly high instep so I went a full size up to the 8 Fit like a glove The arch support was in just the right spot  Ive NEVER felt so supported by any boot before hiking or otherwise There is comfortable padding on the ankle so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone Also the weight of these boots is incredible SO LIGHT I feel like Im wearing sneakersThe other day I took them for a test walk through a local stream and while I stayed mostly on the sandymuddy bank I did occasionally walk through the water to see how the waterproofness held up EXCELLENT I could feel the coolness of the water but my socks stayed 100 dryIve gotten lots of compliments already and they are by far the coolest looking hiking boots Ive owned I love that the design is not TOO overly outdoorsy looking and doesnt have a lot of extra straps in the design ie keen or LL Bean  bootsBuy these boots and you wont be sorry Donâ\\x80\\x99t waste your time with these  So I bought the boots in October of 2019  Yes they are very comfortable and light but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe Itâ\\x80\\x99s the area where the foot would flex as you step  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects Sounds great They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that Iâ\\x80\\x99m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself Sounds great but that didnâ\\x80\\x99t happen either they send me a return label and will refund me 80 of the boot value because itâ\\x80\\x99s considered a late return  Failure from both companies The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are 100Update1302020  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract  Once I got this through for Vasque to understand they offered me a replacement pair of boots making good with their warranty  It was a fight but I am getting new boots from the manufacturer Just received bought the eggplant I love this show Not hiked in it yet though It has a high arch support and a padded super comfy heap So for people with heal pain great shoe My normal size is 85 I ordered a 9 based on reviews that it runs small Well I now need a 95 so asking seller if they will exchange This is not a shoe for a wide footed person but if you are a regular Vasque purchaser you will know that I would have given 5 stars but for the hassle of having to exchange and hope I donâ\\x80\\x99t get charged extra because shoe runs small I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season For the past three months Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had these boots and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve really loved them Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got a nice tread that Iâ\\x80\\x99m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day but they donâ\\x80\\x99t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soilLike any boot that isnâ\\x80\\x99t a rubber rain boot they will get moist in the inside if Iâ\\x80\\x99m really soaking them in puddles and such but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when Iâ\\x80\\x99m walking through dewy grass I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions thoughThe best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility My feet and legs really enjoy the sneakerlike feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got lead weights on my feet Additionally theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the dayFinally Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been working in 90 degree days in these and when Iâ\\x80\\x99m wearing my summer weight socks Iâ\\x80\\x99m not get boiling hot feet So thatâ\\x80\\x99s a huge plusJust remember to size up I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet my feet are a relatively normal width maybe a tiny bit wide but after even a day of wearing them they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to dateFor reference I typically am walking 35 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching which is always the first place to â\\x80\\x9cgoâ\\x80\\x9d in my work bootsSo far theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been worth the investment We will see in a few months how they actually hold up to eastern PA farming I want to love these shoes but theres one MAJOR flaw with the design of these shoes witch make these a dealbreaker for me Ive been hiking for years and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge which means when you lean your anke to the side there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support and youre going down All that time an money for product development Im surprised that this got overlooked Its a bummer because these would otherwise be great shoes If you want an expensive pair of comfortable rugged shoes for walking on flat surfaces then these would be fine The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fitthey literally fit like a glove  snug and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot  At first I found them to be too small that is until I realized they just fit closer to my footâ\\x80\\x99s natural shape than normal shoes do  If youâ\\x80\\x99re used to the way American work boots fit extremely large you may find these â\\x80\\x9ctoo smallâ\\x80\\x9d  They have a deep heal cup pretty high arch support and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe  I also like that the sole isnâ\\x80\\x99t overly wedged forward like a running shoe it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain  In fact after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long offtrail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable  The lacing system is pretty normal nothing funky but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks  in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe giving a momentary â\\x80\\x9cfeet tied together type fallthis is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrousdeadlyI like these boots so much Iâ\\x80\\x99m buying a second pair incase theyâ\\x80\\x99re discontinued I have been using Vasque boots for over 20 years with great satisfaction  Specially the Breeze series that is an exceptional combination between comfort support and lightweight for hiking in hot weatherThese shoes are exceptionally light but offer almost no support  They are fresh foam based and overly flexible  I am very disappointed and recommend not buying this product even to walk in the city let alone for a trail I read the reviews about the tightness I dont have wide feet I wear thick socks too I went a 12 size up like you should on hiking boots They did seem snug at first but I wore around the house and decided to give them a try Im so glad I did I either got used to them or they did seem to break without discomfort That first time I realized I could run in them too I use these to run on hiking trails and my feet and legs dont get tired I love these bootstrail runners FYI they have a 6mm heel to toe drop They are cute and very nicely made but I cant get comfortable in them Iâ\\x80\\x99m a plain clothes police officer and I was looking for comfortable good looking daily wear all weather boots I purchased these to try them out hoping theyâ\\x80\\x99d work out The first day I wore them I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F They were perfectI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe how good they get over the course of the training I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work Overall these boots are incredibly light very good arch support excellent traction adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity i donâ\\x80\\x99t have any experience with these types of boots mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 original Blackhawk Oakley Viktos Nike FSB and my last were Solomon These blow them all away in the comfort department though I know theyâ\\x80\\x99re not very comparable My only advice is I run between an 85 and a 9 I bought 9â\\x80\\x99s which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small The difference may be negligible to most but figured Iâ\\x80\\x99d mention it I love wearing these and didnâ\\x80\\x99t realize there were boots out there quite this comfortableUPDATE2 months in of almost daily wear multiple outdoor range dates 4 days straight of outdoor training at 8 hrs per day on my feet These boots are absolutely outstanding so comfortable supportive and waterproofmy only gripe is the treads are so good that itâ\\x80\\x99s a little hard to get the mud and grass out of them afterwards I ordered this shoe for my daughter and it was true to size  She loved it  The order was shipped in a timely manner and the price was reasonable I love these hikers They are extremely comfortable I received them the day before my hiking trip and wore them to break them in they were perfect I wore them for about nine hours the next day and never felt more comfort They were comfortable around foot gave a little bounce back when I walked and great ankle support I will say if you have a wider foot this is not for you I have a narrow to medium foot and at first was afraid of the snugness but I was able to wear a thick hiking sock and it was fine I would highly recommend these and will be purchasing more Perfect fit great price happy daughter I am now making up words to satisfy the minimum word count that is ridiculous I got these shoes for my daughter who plays volleyball Great purchase She loves them They are comfortable and really excels her game Great shoes at a great price Were delivered earlier than expected  which is always a good thing Amazon is the way to go Ho acquistato queste scarpe per utilizzarle in palestra principalmente per step e allenamento funzionale Svolgono egregiamente la loro funzione hanno un buon grip  sono carine sono leggere non molto traspiranti a mio parere hanno laria abbastanza sintetica ma per il prezzo pagato sono unottima alternativa Le sconsiglio tuttavia a chi ha la pianta larga sostengono il piede con un elastico interno che permetterebbe quasi di evitare di allacciarle ma inizialmente stringe Ormai le sto usando da un mese e sono portabili ma allinizio ho avuto paura di aver sbagliato numero nonostante alla prima prova mi fossero sembrate giuste Purtroppo la differenza si sente indossandole per un pÃ² di tempo ad oggi renderei un mezzo numero in piÃ¹ Las zapatillas estÃ¡n bien por el precio que pague la parte de delante hace una forma redondeada un poco extraÃ±a no las he estrenado en principio tienen pinta de ser cÃ³modas Fit is snugger than I was expecting tongue connected to the interior sole by elastic so I notice it as I have a high arch  One shoelace arrived with the end ripped off and frayed missing piece not in box making it too short and preventing me from lacing in the eyelets Muy grandes Ottima calzata Consiglio di prendere una taglia piÃ¹ grande perchÃ© vestono piccolo Sono confortevoli e adatte soprattutto a chi fa crossfit Muy contenta con este producto Buen resultado y muy cÃ³modas para practicar CrossFit Son muy cÃ³modas y sujetan muy bien el pie Las recomiendo Son muy cÃ³modas se ajustan bien al pie el color es algo mÃ¡s llamativo que en la fotoSon ideales para work out  sin duda las recomiendo Son muy cÃ³modas muy buena compra Son falsas Chaussures trÃ¨s jolies mais qui ne durent pas Au prix quâ\\x80\\x99elles coÃ»tent dans les boutiques ou sur le net câ\\x80\\x99est honteux Je ne rachÃ¨terai plus jamais de chaussures de cette marque je suis trop dÃ©Ã§ue par la qualitÃ© Belle chaussure mais se dÃ©chire facilement sur le dessus TrÃ¨s dÃ©Ã§us Mauvaise qualitÃ© Le tissus se

A unos 80â\\x82¬ que la pude comprar es sencillamente espectacular no se puede pedir mÃ¡s BÃ¡sicamente son unas zapatillas trail running mÃ¡xima amortiguaciÃ³n para tener la posibilidad de largos trayectos tipo ultraSon excelentes en casi todo quizÃ¡s los cordones son algo delgados pero puedes mejorar esto Diese Schuhe sind einfach nur topTotal schÃ¶n von der Form recht aufwendig und gut verarbeitetBeinahe zu schade sie zu tragenIch bin begeistert Las zapatillas mÃ¡s cÃ³modas que he tenido Si necesitas amortiguaciÃ³n estas son una gran opciÃ³nLa pena es que si las utilizas en asfalto se desgasta rÃ¡pidamente la suelaEl resto de la zapatilla estÃ¡ impecable Der Schuh fÃ¤llt klein aus normalerweise trage ich 45 bis 45 13 aber bei diesem Schuh sind es tatsÃ¤chlich 46 23Der Schuh ist leicht und hat eine weiche Sohle die beim Laufen schÃ¶n dÃ¤mpft Son preciosas pero mejor pedir mÃ\\xadnimo 1 nÃºmero mÃ¡s Las he tenido que devolver â\\x98¹ï¸\\x8f Ottimo prodotto acquistate anche in unaltra colorazione Scarpe molto belle e comode forse un po calde in estate Son muy cÃ³modas ademÃ¡s de ligeras Habe dann gerade die letzten beiden PAARE in meiner GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe auch noch bestellt Buenas zapatillas para caminos yo pistas de tierra o piedra suelta El color me gustÃ³ mucho es mÃ¡s rosa que como se ve en la foto sÃ³lo no le doy 5 estrellas porque el acabado de la gamuza es mucho menos liso en un tenis que en el otro pero ya puestos no se nota Al principio se sentÃ\\xadan algo pesados por la plataforma pero estÃ¡n muy padres y cÃ³modos al caminar Buen DÃ\\xadaestÃ¡n padrisimos los tenis pero la verdad no se si de casualidad manejan una talla mas pequeÃ±a es que si me queda casi un numero grandeojala pudieran contestarmegracias I got the olive green great fit with a half size down my usual size Great sole great grip and very firm on the feet Not loose at all I am happy with the purchase Loving these too much I usually wear a Womenâ\\x80\\x99s size 7 but I got a 65 and they fit perfect I have these in white size 7 and they run a little large I would size down half a size Super cute and comfortable These are the most illfitting Pumas ive ever had And the laces are more like ribbons than actually shoelaces I have wider feet but that was never a problem with any other Pumas ive had I had just got some similar orange platform ones and they were the best ever these were the worst Way too tight i thought it was just me at first but then i didnt wear them for a while and nothing else hurt my feet Then i just thought id need to break them in but i walked 10 painful miles at least in them over the past two months and my feet still hurt from wearing them two days ago Nice color but shitty laces and too narrow Firstly the package when getting these shoes  is phenomenal IT is a box within another box Very secure Open feeling the shoes you notice its great quality You can feel the laces are a step up from regular laces I usually wear 9 but got a 9 12 due to shoes being a little narrow due to passed experiences But the shoe fits to perfection and I got black to use more often  I absolutely love them  Super nice and the platform helps with confidence and its slightly curved but it works well for back Donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to say canâ\\x80\\x99t tell itâ\\x80\\x99s true or fake product  thatâ\\x80\\x99s why gave 4 stars but itâ\\x80\\x99s heavier than regular sneakers it makes you look cool whatever style you are in and color is way light than in the display picture overall just wearing a regular branded sneaker which donâ\\x80\\x99t know true or fake These shoes are adorable and the touches like the suede and ribbon laces make them stand out without being obnoxious But the platform is made of concrete I think At least it feels like Im walking with bricks on my feet Theres no flex at all and zero cushion Id say buy a size up and put an insert in but they run kind of big and even an insert wouldnt make up for the fact that the shoes will not allow your foot to bend at all I gave these shoes a three star because they are stylish and fit However they are extremely uncomfortable to walk in The built in insole feels like its designed to make your feet hurt It would be fine If you could remove the insole it comes with but not only is it sewn in its glued in as well so to try and take it out your self would ruin the shoe if you really want the shoe Buy a size up and put a thick insole in and that will solve the problem If you dont feel like going through that dont get the shoe I love Geox shoes and I always buy size 105 which fit perfectly This time I ordered my usual Geox size but the shoes were too narrow I returned them and ordered size 11 and they fit nicely I bought them in the  blue colour which is darker than the pictures more dark navy Very elegant Sehr schÃ¶ner bequemer SchuhAnziehen und loslaufen Auch fÃ¼r komplizierte FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe gut geeignetDie Farbe hellgrÃ¼n erscheint mir mit einem Touch

de esta marca los conservarÃ© para un regalo navideÃ±o  Los seleccionados eran con camuflaje en verde olivo y llegaron en color  amarillo fosforescente  Love the shoes hate the packaging from Amazon This may be small to others but I keep my boxes for all my shoes and Amazon shipped my shoes in a plastic bag instead of a box When I received the shoes my box was destroyed Me gustaron mucho pero tengo que regresar el producto porque aunque los pedÃ\\xad de la talla que habitualmente uso me quedaron muy justos tanto de lo largo como del empeine del pie Si se deciden por ellos pidan por lo menos un nÃºmero mÃ¡s grande del que usan Muy bien producto en caja original Parfait I wear a womens size 12 US which generally translates to a mens size 10 After reading the reviews I ordered a 105 and I could not be happier I love the look of these shoes I removed the laces Since the shoe fits like a sock and I dont plan on running in them I didnt really see a point of having the laces there Plus they kinda rubbed my foot in a weird way They feel absolutely perfect without laces I have a rather narrow foot If you have a wide foot I dont think you would find this shoe to your liking The grey color is perfect for me and I love the little splashes on the tread at the side I also love the weave look of the shoe Overall a great shoe at a great price Ive own two other HyperGELKAN shoes and I love them all These shoes breathe easily and feel great once you break them in I wear these daily People say they run a bit small but I think for being being athletic shoes they fit different So you should go one size bigger and give them a try Very comfortable I thought they were too small vertically at first but after breaking them in they are very comfortableOnly good for running on flat surfaces no ankle support Tried running on a trail and rolled ankle within 30 seconds I did buy a size up due to previous reviews and I am glad I did Shoes are very comfortable I have a lot of issue with my arches and the balls of my feet but while wearing these shoes I have had no pain It was time for some new shoes so these were chosen Great quality shoe and very comfortable I took the shoelaces out for extra comfort and notice the fabric giving me more flexibility Love these shoes Amazing shoe Very comfortable My size is a 10 would recommend a 105 or even 11 if you have a wide foot

This shoe is well built one of the best looking hiking shoes I came across above average quality and really slick design Its a bit heavy but its a waterproof GORETEX hiking shoe with thick sole so its expectedUnfortunately did not work for me  Going half size up was a good decision but the shoe feels tight around the arch and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable To add insult to injury no pun intended although I can easily imagine injuries at pressure points after long hikes it really cuts bad into the foot just proximal to the toes and only one shoe Virtually impossible to walk without discomfort Sadly no matter how much I liked them had to return I loved the shoe but unfortunately didnâ\\x80\\x99t work for me I apparently needed a wider width so have to go to a specialty store for my shoes I ordered size 5 in wide it fits me so perfect love the design color very helpful for me for my 8 hours work at the hospital and it gives me height as well Love them  Great running shoes Fit as expected My husband is an iron worker Used these less than a month and the seams are already poppingleather didnâ\\x80\\x99t hold up well Theyâ\\x80\\x99re comfortable but that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean much when they fall apart less than a month in Constructionsi vous portez du 10 nâ\\x80\\x99hÃ©sitez pas Ã\\xa0 commander du 95 a part Ã§a câ\\x80\\x99est un bon produit les semelles intÃ©rieures sont ordinaires aussivous pouvez penser Ã\\xa0 les remplacer dÃ¨s lâ\\x80\\x99achat Ive worn these boots to work for 10 days and the leather is already peeling and cracking I used mink oil when new and wore them around the house for a few days to break them in Im a crane operator so fair to say my boots dont typically see a lot of rough environment Its really too bad because they are very comfortable and look great  Guess thats why theyre cheap Comfortable and light boot specially like the soft rubber sole instead of soft foam took about 2 weeks to break them in but thatâ\\x80\\x99s typical They are a snug boot Iâ\\x80\\x99m a size 10 in timberland pro or Dakota lined boot 912 unlined dakotas  these I went with a 912 because they are unlined glad I did Great price would definitely buy them again Well made and very comfortable itâ\\x80\\x99s large fitting so you can go down half size I bought the soft toe and steel toe they look well made and hope they last I bought these for my son he was pleased said the fit was good maybe a little big in the width overall a good workboot I havent broken them in yet but so far they are comfortablewill they last as long as my Thorogoods to be continued Hard to break in But once they do they are comfy Took 2 weeks to break in with mink oil I bought these forMy husband and so far these are his favorite boots of all time  he actually wants another pair toWear all the time and one for work cause they fit great there comfy and they look great  Great purchase The sole was cracked Where the sole meats the leather on the arch portion of the foot This causes the boot to leak Should have returned them right away Bought 2 pairs but only 1 pair had the cracked soles Beautiful shoe but fits in the small size I am an avid cyclist and tried to make these shoes work by adjusting my cleats repeatedly and even ordered insoles They just arenâ\\x80\\x99t comfortable and make my feet hurt and toes go to sleep even though I loosen them and the fit is not tight Will only use my Sidis now Love that you can often find expensive cycling gear and reasonable prices on Amazon  I have a slightly narrow foot and have trouble finding road bike shoes that fit my foot securely and comfortably  These are perfect and were at least 100 more on many other websites  Most road bike shoes that fit me are 200 so I was relieved to snag these from amazon Love these shoes Wear them to spin class and they work perfect Very comfortable Nice pair of cycling shoes Fake fake fake In genere destate indosso infradito o scarpe da trekking ma questa estate devo rinunciare a qualsiasi tipo di sandalo perchÃ© indosso calze elastiche Ho cercato perciÃ² scarpe che fossero il piÃ¹ possibile fresche morbide leggere che non aumentassero troppo il caldo provocato dalle calze Ho  avuto la fortuna di trovare queste  le Salomon Tech LiteSemplicemente perfette  Ed anche molto carine son soddisfatta Sehr bequemer Schuh Guter fester Sitz aber trotzdem locker leichtes GefÃ¼hl Perfekt zum Spaziergang bei hohen Temperaturen confortable et aerÃ© Je trouve toutefois que salomon taille

from forest floor to river no problem Love them Ein leichter Sommerschuh zum Sport Das Material ist wunderbar weich Leider ist die Innensohle nicht austauschbar Der Schuh ist schÃ¶n luftig angenehm breit geschnitten nur ist mir das Fussbett im Bereich der Ferse zu hart The bottom of the shoe is solid and bendy which is great but the sides and back of the shoe is flimsy and will be a problem around the sides of my feet Love the solid sole of this light weight shoe but wish Iâ\\x80\\x99d bought it a 12 size smaller Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good looking stylish shoe but there is slippage in the heel when walking Perfectos tal como lo esperaba Ligeros y super cÃ³modos Der Schuh ist echt ein Hingucker Ich finde ihn super modisch und total bequem Die Passform ist ja sehr individuell Damit sich da jeder selbst ein Bild machen kann habe ich die Einlagen anbei als Foto vermessen Der Schuh ist schmal geschnitten sitzt eher fest FÃ¼r krÃ¤ftige FÃ¼sse sicherlich nicht das BesteDas Material ist

schnÃ¼rrsenkel SchnÃ¼rt man sie normal fest drÃ¼cken sie das sie im Durchmesser zu schmal und rund sind Die Schuhe wurden schnell geliefert und waren nach dem Auspacken ein echter Hingucker sehen

ob wohl ich die grÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 41 bestellt die ich bekommen habe sieht die grÃ¶Ã\\x9fe wie 39 zuklein Ich bin mehr als entÃ¤ucht weil ich extra 5â\\x82¬ wegen schneller lieferung bezahlt die kommt 3 tage

lassen sich gut tragen Mal abwartenwie lange sie halten Come scritto prima sono strette sul collo del piede e sono fastidiosi ad indossarle ma nell insieme e un ottimo prodotto Finally a nonbranded product thats great value and quality Happy about my purchase I normally wear 75  I had to return and get a 7 which is still a generous fit but works Llegaron muy bien The toe box is tight but they fit nice as long as you get the right size  Ive already owned a pair of these that I bought in a retail store and they are fantastic  This is a replacement pair  Cant even remember how many complements Ive gotten even from total strangersJust remember to buy the right size LOL  I clicked on the wrong size when I ordered so the pair I got is too small  It was my fault though and Im going to just give them away to someone who might need them  Already bought another pair in the right size although I think they came from a different Amazon seller that time and they are on the way Shoes are narrow Love super comfortable as advertised bad quality dented unvalued shoes Itâ\\x80\\x99s really comfortable Son muy bonitas pero la talla muy pequeÃ±a Uso un 3839 y la 39 me iba muy pequeÃ±a

abbiate gradito la recensione Saluti Sehr angenehm zu tragender und schÃ¶ner SchuhWas die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe angeht so sollte man den FuÃ\\x9f messen und die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe ermitteln Ich habe in lang geschnittenen Herrenschuhen grundsÃ¤tzlich eine GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe weniger wie in Turn bzw Freizeitschuhen was sicherlich auch an meinem schmalen FuÃ\\x9f liegtBezÃ¼glich vermeintlicher Kratzer auf den Schuhen die hier auch als Foto gezeigt wurden muss man sich keine Sorgen machen War bei mir auch der Fall und ich habe schnell festgestellt dass es nur an zu viel Schuhcreme ab Werk liegt Daher auf

ein echtes Leder irgendwie okNicht ok ist die Verarbeitung nach 2maligen Tragen verliert der Schuh seine Form es fehlt ein festeres Gewebe das das weiche Leder in Position hÃ¤lt Hatte aufgrund der vielen negativen Bewertungen dass der Schuh viel zu groÃ\\x9f ausfallen wÃ¼rde GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 45 statt 46 bestellt Leider ein Fehler da die 45er zu klein sind Gar nicht unbedingt von der GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe der Sohle her aber vom KnÃ¶chel und der Ferse hat es doch unangenehm und deutlich gedrÃ¼ckt Daher nun 46er bestellt ich habe immer so zwischen 45 und 46 je nach Hersteller und die passen nun perfekt und sitzen bequem Insofern nicht unbedingt eine oder zwei Nummer zu groÃ\\x9f Zumindest nicht bei mir 4 Sterne da leichte Spuren auf der Oberseite zu sehen sind Dies mag bei dieser Lederart vorkommen

que lÃ©tiquette Retour dÃ¨s demain Wie von der Marke erwartet passt wie angegossen gute Verarbeitung und sehr schnelle Lieferung Gerne wieder These sneakers are attractive lightweight and the overall construction seems good I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids sneakers The sizing like other sneaker companies is strange I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes My kids also gravitate to the wide width even though they dont have wide feet Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers but once I figured these out we were setThe reason for the 3 star rating After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoeAfter wearing them for a couple days my son commented on how loose they felt The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity It would not take much time for them to become way too looseFinally I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces It was still problematic because the top hole where the original ones were glued was unusable for the new laces The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son cant lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able toBottom line these sneakers turned out to be a mess Ive been pleased with New Balance in the past and will continue to purchase their products BUT I will absolutely make sure I never purchase sneakers with unadjustable fixed laces again Whatâ\\x80\\x99s not to love This may be the BEST shoes for kids It is my absolute favorite of all the amount of shoes ever purchased for my kids this is hands down the most amazing pair It does not require the kids to tie faster for kids to put on comfort fit great colors and design no snagging on the tongue of shoes nor does it elastic on the â\\x80\\x9clacesâ\\x80\\x9d become loose Even my kids say itâ\\x80\\x99s now their favorite Wished the shoes industry would make more of these for kids The best invention of shoes for kids You will not regret purchasing far too often I find myself writing reviews saying others knew what they were talking about  My son has fairly narrow feet but after wearing these 1 or 2 times he told me they werent comfortable and pointed to the end of the laces as hurtingI believe the problem is that the elastic laces dont adjust very much  I was able to pull the elastic out there and make a little bit of an adjustment so hopefully we can get SOME wear out of themwish I could return them thoughIf your child has wider feet as mine always have been you shouldnt even consider this product weâ\\x80\\x99ve saved ourselves some drama getting ready for school in the morning because these shoes are lightweight and easy to get on and off Another reviewer said the elastic laces make them a little big but we havenâ\\x80\\x99t found that to be true in our case I assume it depends on how theyâ\\x80\\x99re sized to your childWe also got a really good deal on these My 10 year old son picked these out They looked really good and fit him well The only problem is the elastic laces When he runs plays or makes a cut his foot slides out He really did not like wearing them because he could not play in them I had to cut out the elastic laces and replace them with regular tennis show laces These shoes are FANTASTIC  I have 2 boys who constantly run around with their shoes untied  These have been a life saver for kids who have not yet learned to tie their shoes  Plus they are stylish sturdy and reasonably priced  I came back the website just to order more sizes as they grow dont ever get rid of this product Super lightweight nice shoes The only thing is bc of the elastic laces they are a little loose if your child has narrow feet Great price and came quick These sneakers slip on easily They were labeled wide width but I donâ\\x80\\x99t find them very wide They are a full size larger on my sonâ\\x80\\x99s foot but the 105 W shoes we have from New Balance are too short Off sizing Nice color and quality overall A lightweight sneaker These shoes are great for my little guy Theyre comfortable and they are really nice looking He has wide feet and typically has a problem with other shoes He LOVES these  I actually didnt know when I purchased them that they were slip ons and didnt have actual laces This made him even more happy Great buy I have never tried New Balance for my 3 almost 4 year old before He is disabled and stride rites always seem to fit him wide These little New Balance shoes fit him perfectly He has room to grow they are narrow enough that I dont have to purchase special narrow shoes and with the stretchy faux ties he is trying to put them on himself 2 Things 1 it is true size a lot of the shoes on Amazon may not be  but this is so if you are size 8 order 8 not 812 2 They are one of the comfortable ones in maybe hundreds because I have had to order more than 20 different models to finally find this to be only the 2nd one that was as comfy a fit as it looks plus it is an Adidas so it is qualityThe problem it was used and the box and inside of it were reallllly bad too and they lie easily  When I ordered it it said there was only 1 leftWhich I got  but just before returning them I checked again and no messages like that so my rating applies to This particular pair ONLY  BUT THE SHOE IS A GREAT SHOE Fits perfect to size and I love the color the shoes are for man  not for woman as they say in the description Everything is okay ð\\x9f¤£ I love them I just wish they had them in my size in the white Buenas y cÃ³modas de calidad media I have a wider foot and these fit great Super comfortable and easy to wash after being out in the mud I put them through the washing machine and they came out good as new Love these So light comfortable and look super cute Good looking shoe The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and thatâ\\x80\\x99s soooo annoying But determined to want to keep them because they are attractive and slip on I wanted them for a work from home house shoe I put a pair of Dr Scholls in soles inside them Theyâ\\x80\\x99d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you  it worked splendidly I now LOVE these shoes They are like walking on marshmallows True to size Attractive Super comfy Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning Iâ\\x80\\x99d say if youâ\\x80\\x99re looking for a â\\x80\\x9chouse slipperâ\\x80\\x9d quality shoe  this is it Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great Without the insoles I would have had to return them I really dont like these They fit strange and are not comfortable I have several pairs of sneaker type shoes for work and these are at the very bottom of my rotation to wear Wish i had just gone to kohls or something to try before i bought them They are narrow and too big This is the size i normally buy in shoes but they are too big length wise and too small width wise for my feet I bought these shoes for casual comfy days  Do I plan on running in these  No  In all fairness I probably wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t run in any shoes unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth  These shoes were instantly comfortable I wear a 995  The ball part of my foot is med to wide the heel of my foot is narrow These work great  I ordered 95 and these are true to size They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width I can tied the securely so the heel fits I love the cushy memory foam I plan on wearing these at Disney they are that comfortable  They look pretty good If I survive walking 510 miles at Disney I will come back and update my post Disney experience If I donâ\\x80\\x99t survive it probably was no fault of these shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99d say one too many ice creams or getting into deadly fight triggered by one too many renditions of â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a Small Worldâ\\x80\\x9d Our daughter is a varsity basketball player  Most players finish practice and go to their slides  She wanted something that was easy to slip into but still secure as she has to drive about 30 miles to the practice facilityShe loves them and wears them all the time  Around the house running errands pre  post practice  She says that they are super comfortable  Highly Recommend I am highly impressed with these tennis shoes Very comfortable I have worn them for 16 hours straight with no problem This is huge for me because my arches usually start to hurt No problems at all Fits true to size Lightweight and love the style These shoes DO feel like a cloud They are so comfortable Ive never owned any adidas but Im so glad my friends told me to buy these They feel like sneaker slippers due to not having a shoe tonguethey feel great to run in I would only suggest to size down though Got a 95 and could have easily done a 9 These are comfortable and I love that they are pull on I love the simple and classic design They definitely run big Amazon said â\\x80\\x9cfits as expectedâ\\x80\\x9d and recommended a size 10 I got a 95 based on other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s reviews and actually could have gone with a 9 So they are comfortable for walking but I would not want to run in them I would buy again but definitely recommend going down a size or two Love these

cute but were too â\\x80\\x9cclunkyâ\\x80\\x9d for my 3 12 year old They didnâ\\x80\\x99t adjust small enough to fit her and the base of the sandal didnâ\\x80\\x99t bend so she was unable to walk in them We returned them which the seller was great about I would not recommend for littler kids but perhaps ages 6 and up These are nice casual summer sandals  great for beach pool etc  Daughter loves them  Sizing seems OK in the kids sizes  The main drawbacks we see so far are1 the rainbowcolored straps show dirt very easily and2 while the foam footbed is soft  comfy it will wear down fast I wanted to love these shoes for my daughter BUT they were too small We were sent a infant size and thatâ\\x80\\x99s not what I purchased When receiving these shoes off the bat I realized these were something for looks rather than looks and being comfortable for my toddler to either A dress up in and B be able to walk for hours in them without cutting in to her feet Sadly these werenâ\\x80\\x99t what I thought they were These are the best shoes for kids So comfortable and they last for a long time These have been the perfect summer shoes for my 7 year old daughter She can run and play in them and they hold up great I bought a second pair because we love them so much And super stylish surferlike look too Cute and comfy sandals fits perfectly on my daughter Bien

Ich habe drei Paar dieser Hausschuhe GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 29 bestellt Alle Schuhe wurden ohne Innensohle geliefert Was nun Ich habe diese Hausschuhe in der Vergangenheit regelmÃ¤Ã\\x9fig  mehrfach bestellt und war immer sehr zufriedenOhne Innensohle bieten diese Schuhe keine TragequalitÃ¤t Eigentlich 5 Sterne leider jetzt nur 1 Se las comprÃ© a mi hijo de 10 aÃ±os y le quedan perfectas muy cÃ³modas Sind wirklich gut und QualitÃ¤t stimmt auch Beautiful but too small I ordered the wrong size schnelle lieferung ware ok gerne wieder The shoe itself was exactly what I had expected I bought this to replace a worn pair at the same size and this was larger somehow than my previous pair Pretty sure that I havent shrunk since I purchased the last pair sooooo Love these shoes They fit my big feet size 12 perfectly Super comfy and easy to slide on Used them almost all the time till my previous pair literally gave out which is when I bought the exact same pair Most comfortable shoes I own  Look great too I love these shoes Love them I love these sneakers I bought 2 in white  in case one pair needed a wash and I think Ill get another n a color I have always liked Sherry shoes and these were a good price The shoes were as advertised and arrived on time The shoes are a bit tight no wide width available but the length is accurate  Good quality and very nice looking Love them Titel ARA Damen Rom Sneaker und auf dem Foto ein Schuh mit ReiÃ\\x9fverschlussGeliefert wurde ein brauner ARA Osaka ohne ReiÃ\\x9fverschlussDeshalb RÃ¼cksendung Schuh passt sehr gut  sehr gute QualitÃ¤t der Schuhe passen wie erwartet sehr bequem Man sollte allerdings auf die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe achten er fÃ¤llte sehr groÃ\\x9f aus besser eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer kaufen Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort but man do these things rockI have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their outofthebox bangon comfort and fit you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head they were that good As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didnt cinch down enough for my ankles They always felt loose on me going down half a size didnt helpAfter my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle I looked for a bit more athletic hiker not a Trail Runner but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews I saw the magic words Large Toebox and Great for wide feet I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3miler on varied terrain and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes The fit is on a another level so much more secure than the Moab 2s and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I dont feel boxy and like Im wearing hiking boots The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste The quicklacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fastpaced hikes which is what I enjoyI do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP especially for someone like me with my foot issues not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2sIts only been one hike but I love them so far and dont see any issues coming up in the future The threads are showing on both toe covers in under 100 miles  Ive been walking everyday in these shoes for just under 4 weeks which I average about 3 to 4 miles per day  I probably have about 80  90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposureIm filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goesAs for the fit I initially struggled with trying to like these as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells  Im an 11W and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit but Ive been satisfied with comfort after the first dayThe first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful  One foot felt off centered the other ankle lace was digging into my skin  However after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again Ive been happy every since  So dont be completely discouraged by first impressions it may just take a little adjusting First I want to say that I am a woman and I buy mens shoes to get the width I need  I have a neuroma in one foot and a fibroma in the other along with high arches  I need very wide shoes and lots of cushioning  I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me so the others were returned  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths and Moab Edge 2  I wear a size 8 to 85 in womens shoes mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs  In a mens shoe I go down 1 to 15 sizes  In this shoe a mens 7 wide was perfect  No you wont get the Vibram sole but comfort was more important to me than the sole material Total disappointment you certainly dont get what you pay for 8000 with these  Merrell is supposed to be a good name with a good reputation for quality shoes but unfortunately it hasnt been my experience with the last to pairs of hiking shoes Ive purchased of theirsI had these barely 4 months and both heels already had holes worn through the sole  See attached pics  Merrell minimizing material costs by reducing the thickness of the sole is just unacceptable for an 8000 shoeI certainly wont be purchasing Merrell any longerColumbia are on my radar now Delivery was on time and no damages As with all the other Merrell footwear I have purchased these shoes are of the quality I expect from them This is first time I have ordered Merrell products on Amazon so not sure if that is the reason for my issue I order 105 US from Merrell for all my hiking and general purpose shoes but these seem about half an inch shorter in length than all my other 105 Merrell shoes And I found out that Merrell lowered their price of this shoe to 80  so I did not save any money by buying from Amazon Lesson learned I will NOT be purchasing footwear from Amazon in the future I paid the same on Amazon as Merrells website and the fit is not the same as I expect Tried to save a few dollars and screwed myself I have had a pair of Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes that I use almost daily for my walking regiment and I have also used them twice walking sections of the Appalacian Trial and they have worn like iron The only place they have shown much wear is the back of the shoe at the heel I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they dont look too bad for old hiking shoes but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just arent pristine looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics parties and eating out with my wife I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 15 to 2 mile daily walks with them Its like they were already brokenin and I dont get any blisters or sore areas on my feet or heels from using them new right out of the box Updating my review below after Ive been wearing these shoes for about two weeksIn addition to being smaller than the actual size and too narrow they do not have much cushioning which causes some heel pain after a long walk I would return them but my guess it is too latePrevious reviewThese are indeed finelooking shoes comfortable and cushy Hopefully they will serve me wellOn the downside they are not exactly true to size size 11 actually feels like 105 Also they are moderately uneven left shoe looks somewhat narrower and slightly curved toward the inside From my personal experience these dont even come close to moabs Tried them hoping to get a good pair of Merrills for less then what I was used to spending  I regret the decision While they fit well enough and have plenty of space They dont provide the same support 2 months in and my feet hurt walking in them for extended periods of time It took my last pair of moabs well over a year to get to this point  Unfortunately Ill end up buying a new pair of shoes much sooner then expected because I tried to save a few bucks I ordered these in a wide since Ive been having issues with other shoe manufacturers being too small and tight but I could have gotten by with the standard width I will continue to by Merrell shoes since they last forever and their shoe size fits as expected Ho acquistato queste scarpe per la nuova stagione avendo giÃ\\xa0 avuto altre Mizuno nelle stagioni precedenti e le sto usando da settembre La scarpa Ã¨ esteticamente bella ed Ã¨ molto comoda Le prime

and summer of course id recommend you buy them i bought every color Im already 6ft but I was curious how this works  I figure women can automatically grow 3 inches taller with high heels why cant guys try itWell it did work with the height jump  Its amazing feeling walking in a public place and all of the sudden looking down more on peoples heads  The only downside it they begin to hurt your feet after an hour or so  Its not horrible and maybe thats what women deal w via high heels  But if there was a way around this it would be nice Purchased these shoes for my Fiance to wear at our wedding in hopes it would give a little more height in our pictures  We love them  They look better in person  My Fiance said they fit very comfy  I guess the true test will be on our wedding day but so far everything looks great Walking in them feels absolutely terrible Like walking in loose heels or something Perhaps feels better if they fit Too tight Great shoe high quality The extra height adds confidence I was shocked of the quality perfection in every way they are very comfortable a little loud when walking on hard Floors but other than that they are amazing Nice elevation and style but toe area is tight and it hurts after a while Me agrado el estilo la elegancia y el Material de confecciÃ³n Its a little to moderately tight across the toe area El precio es genial La marca es de mucha calidad por lo que la oferta es lo que me convenciÃ³ para la compra Top class product High quality Original Perfect fit Very comfortable Nice colour Bought for my wife She is liking it a lot Shoes fit well with socks Comfortable and great for long brisk walk or runFoot width matches perfectly No soreness felt in either foot  Great product Worth the money and meets expectations Da menos talla y de la punta es muy cerrado Not fit for sports personit fales side when we run Prima Es muy cerrado y duro en el empeine si es como la foto pero lo comprÃ© un poco mÃ¡s grande para que no me molestara en la parte trasera del pies y al caminar me saco ampolla Trotz gleicher SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe und scheinbar gleichem Nachfolgeprodukt des Nike Shield Zoom Winflo 4 ist der Schuh viel zu klein ausgefallen Versand Zustellung und RÃ¼cknahme waren in Ordnung Perfect shoes for Running Wrong description by Amazon It is not size 45 UK but 4UK This pair of shoes is amazing  My first good pair of running shoes since i started running last year  This size fits me perfectly and I have an average width foot for a lady I also have a high arch and these support me well No foot pain on my walk run with these shoes  I havent tested out the water resistance on them yet because they look too good to get dirty  Would definitely recommend this shoe Die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt wie erwartet  hier entspricht die 38 auch einer 38 Ich habe vorn einen recht breiten FuÃ\\x9f und die Schuhe bieten genug Platz ohne zu drÃ¼cken Die Verarbeitung ist gut und ich finde sie lassen sich vielseitig zu Hosen Leggings und Kleidern kombinieren Pies tal cual en la fotografÃ\\xada es un diseÃ±o bonito y cÃ³modo Para quiÃ©nes busquen un pie de gato confortable con una suela plana Los recomiendo tanto para iniciaciÃ³n como

de ayuda y referencia Son los primeros pies de gato que tengo Los he utilizado para Boulder y muy bienPrimeramente pedi 37 13 ya que suelo calzar un 37 pero tuve que cambiarlos por un nÃºmero mÃ¡s el

Â¡Viva la originalidad Me ha encantado el diseÃ±o y estaban a buen precio Estoy encantada  Las habÃ\\xada visten tienda mÃ¡s caras Son muy bonitas como en la foto When I ordered this sneakers I checked the sizes My size is 6 and in the size chart it says size 4 UK is size 6 so I clicked that When it arrived I saw its size 7 I had this delivered in my friends place in USA because I lived in the Philippines My friend brought it today I love everything the style color except that its not my size My colleagues suggested to just wear 2 socks because its really nioce on me and it fits my personality Is it possible to have it changed Please let me know Ich habe inzwischen 150km im Hyperion Tempo absolviert Vom 7km Fartlek 10km Tempoeinheit und dem HM in 75 Pace  der Hyperion Tempo macht eine super Figur Das Zusammenspiel von DÃ¤mpfung Direktheit und Leichtigkeit ist aus meiner Sicht hervorragend Doch der Reihe nachGewicht Der Schuh ist nicht nur leicht er fÃ¼hlt sich auch genauso an und lÃ¤uft sich besonders bei schnellen km sehr gut Die Mittelsohle ist nicht zu schmal aber das DNA Loft Material ist super und bietet ausreichend DÃ¤mpfung was nicht zu lasten des Gewichts gehtDÃ¤mpfung FÃ¼r reine VersenlÃ¤ufer ist der Schuh sicher nicht die beste Wahl fÃ¼r MittelfuÃ\\x9flÃ¤ufer ist er meiner Meinung nach super Die DÃ¤mpfung ist ausreichend man spÃ¼rt die EnergierÃ¼ckgewinnung wenn auch nicht so sehr wie bei einem CarbonSchuh kostet auch wesentlich wenigerFeedback Die Sohle ist zwar nicht sehr dÃ¼nn aber sie gibt viel Feedback So ist der Lauf auf sehr groben Schotterwegen eher gewÃ¶hnungsbedÃ¼rftig Auf Trailabschnitten sowie dem Asphalt spielt der Hyperion Tempo seine StÃ¤rken aus Die Sohle ist sehr haltbar und nach den 150km ist noch kaum Verschleiss an der AuÃ\\x9fensohle zu sehenDie SchnÃ¼rsenkel sind sehr dÃ¼nn und dÃ¼rften etwas kÃ¼rzer sein selbst mit Runners Knot sind sie meiner Auffassung nach noch einen Tick zu langeAlles in allem ein hervorragender schuh von Brooks  mit dem sich bei jedem Wetter laufen lÃ¤sst und man lange 650km SpaÃ\\x9f haben kannSofern die Rezension hilfreich war freue ich mich Ã¼ber ein Daumen nach

pour mon premier marathon Paris 17 octobre 2021 These shoes work better the faster I go Mercurys wings on my feet Best way to describe the feeling is with each step its like a little hand tapping up from the ground into my foot Sounds crazy but the technology is there Light weight Hyperion tempo felt great even after a 10 mile race I left them on afterwards and did not feel any discomfort This shoe is made for competitive running and would not recommend training in them but you can Light soft but responsive cushion comfortable stretchy uppers laces that flex  These are a dreamIn the words of Drake â\\x80\\x9cYou the best Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever hadâ\\x80\\x9d Gift for soninlaw and he says the fit is great You feel very quick in these shoes Not for the beginner if training for distance running Overall very well made Will definitely recommend I am so glad I discovered the yellow box flip flops Not only do they look and fit great but they also offer great cushion when walking and as I suffer from plantar fasciitis it is extremely helpful I ordered two more of a different designs as soon as I received these and walked around in them for a couple of days They are worth every penny and most likely Ill never buy another brand again I definitely recommend this product I love everything about these flip flops  No pain between toes  Cushiony foot bed These are amazing  So comfortable  Gives you a spring in your step  Best of all the piece between your toes does not hurt Very comfortable and beautiful Comfortable cushiony sole Soft fabric between toe band suitable for sensitive toes or toes tightly together Absolutely love these flip flops After receiving my initial order I placed a second order of two more colours They were suppose to be denim and they are plastic A little pricey for foam flip flops  but very nice and extremely comfortable I am happy with them Love these so comfy worth the buy for sure Je les adore La grandeur est bonne elles sont confortables They are very nice shoes and I was super excited to get these shoes as I absolutely need new shoes but I was pretty upset when I tried to get my feet into them and there was just no way I could the material is not stretchy like my last pair of pumas ð\\x9f\\x98\\x94 so definitely make sure you have very slender feet before purchasing these As described unique look Very comfortable Worn them a few times even shopping for at least 2 hrs Love that there are no laces Just slip them on and off I love them so much Iâ\\x80\\x99m a nurse and they keep my feet comfortable These shoes are great if you work on your feet Its fit comfortable  very soft and nice Amazing Love it I like these shoes as a health care worker who is on my feet for 60 hours a week  its all about comfort  Stepping into these is like stepping into a pillow  They are remarkably soft and easy on my feet Puma like Fila the designer I wear run tight across the foot and toe area always for me This shoe however runs tight across the top of the shoe Itâ\\x80\\x99s how the shoe is sewn under the stretch band I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the sock shoe or boot shoe or whatever that shoe is called that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have laces and you have to wrestle with your foot to try and put them in But these shoes I made an exception because of the style I love it Very uncomfortable at first but now after several wears and washes the shoes seem to be more tolerable I get a lot of compliments on these shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99m a 10 but Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I got the 105 I know it made a difference in the fitgreat Too bad the bottom of the shoe wasnâ\\x80\\x99t speckled in gold like the first Puma Prowl but itâ\\x80\\x99s a comfortable nice shoe just the same  I have a white pair of Puma slip on sneakers and I love them but I wore them camping stupidly and they got ruined So Ive been on the hunt for a new pair and I came across these I liked that the style was similar to what I already have and I liked that the sliver straps were sparkly Totally up my alley They look exactly as shown They shipped pretty much right away It didnt take long to receive them When I got them I tried them on and the fit but unfortunately even though I ordered these in my size the material that they are made with probably wasnt the greatest choice because I can see the outline of my foot with the shoe on I can see my toes very easily So I can imagine if I were to wear them out and about people are going to be able to see the shape of my foot and my toes move while walking It looks very odd They are comfortable the material is comfortable but not a good choice Probably for anyone Very lightweight too I will be returning them and continue to look for another pair I really like them They get a little uncomfortable after a whilebut I guess the elastic will need time to stretch See DanGeorge review it is accurate  plus after 2days of wearing the Reebok printed label started wear off The sole of the shoe is so thin you can feel a pebble  very unhappy with the supplier and with Amazon for promoting this garbage  And now I am out almost 13000  THANK YOU AMAZONFollowUp 052821 Went to the Reebok Outlook Mall Store they told me this shoe model  is not one of theirs shoesI tried to make them work for a week  They were so uncomfortable to wear I bought insoles to try to make them comfortable didnt workafter 1 day of wearing the shoes the Reebok logo printd inside the shoe was wearing awayoh While I was at the Reebok Store I purchased a great pair of Reeboks very very comfortable and for only 7300 Bought these in January in April the leather on the right shoe started to bubble In May the left shoe outer seam ripped Im not doing any real activity in these just walking  I think around 5k steps a day This isnt the quality I remember from Reebok Bought for my son for work as he is on his feet all day Great so far El producto es de piel sintÃ©tica por lo que carece de la calidad esperada Por favor no lo publiquen asÃ\\xad porque engaÃ±an al cliente y lo hacen dudar o convencerse de que la prÃ³xima compra volverÃ¡ a ser engaÃ±ado Good thing Very sturdy but comfortable shoe I have worn them for a full day on several occasions with total comfort Incredibly comfortable and stylish Great shoes

I read reviews to help in purchase decisions So I hope this review helps you In a shoe store using gauge I have a mens 1012 D regular width foot actual size  I buy size 11 Wide in everything I buySkecherswork boots etcI like to ensure room for expansion and insert foot beds if needed I bought sof sole gel insoles here on Amazon alsoThese arrived today I ordered 11 XW  They showed on order as 11 4E  Length is goodwidth is slightly snug with or without replacement insoles If you truly have a wide footgood luck Otherwise the insoles are tacky stuck down but are removableinserts make a big difference Quality is goodbright whitelook nice and yes I would recommend These are fire I love them I was scared when ordering these because theyâ\\x80\\x99re so cheap  less than 30 I thought they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be authentic or made out of plastic These are authentic the box was in good condition all labels were on They feel great when I put them on and I donâ\\x80\\x99t see any signs of them being fake Even have memory foam type material at the bottom feels good I have been looking for some nice casual white leather shoes and these slap I get mad compliments Iâ\\x80\\x99m buying all these colors and will post the results I would say that they are slightlyyyy narrow just a little So if you have fat feet that may effect you I didnâ\\x80\\x99t let that effect the rating cause I donâ\\x80\\x99t have that problem Ima do some walking in them if they hurt my feet or somethin Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let yâ\\x80\\x99all know Delivery was quick as promised The product is the same as the one at the store for half the cost Appears to be of the same quality Cant say anything about the durability at this time Fits perfectly and kids love it Thank you Now to find a pair for myself I have a tough time sizing my kids cleats because the shoes mostly run narrow  Our soccer also go back and forth between turf and grass during the season and my kid doesnt like traditional cleats notably on harder surfaces  He also usually blows out his shoes during a season  This shoe gets 5 stars for lasting a season and for fitting on a little wider foot  The grip from the shorter cleats also work well for a kid on grass even a bigger one like mine  Buying the adult version this year for baseball same issue with spiky cleats especially using artificial pitching mounds and soccer as he has grown out of the kid size These are visibly way too narrow Too narrow for the average human foot My kid only wore them once He said they hurt I shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve returned them My daughter loves it She is 7 and plays indoor soccer on turf She said the shoes are comfy and flexible I will be being the cleata version of these for the spring season El producto sugiere que es talla de niÃ±os pero cuando abrÃ\\xad el paquete es talla de hombres entonces mi zapato es mucho mas grande de lo que esperaba el tono no es el mimo de la foto en la foto se ve blanco y rosado En realidad es un tono medio brilloso blanco y un tipo anaranjadoen vez del rosa No puedo devolver porq lo pedi por Encargo hasta ECUADOR pÃ©simo NO COMPREN CON ESTE VENDEDOR My daughter loves these shoes They are comfortable for her and she likes the color pattern I am planning on getting a bigger size later on Was a little bit bigger than expected but still nice and comfortable Very nice Very nice and comfortable shoes my son liked them he plays soccer with them and runs great he says they are perfect Daughter wire these to the field right out of the box Comfortable Fits well Well made Used for over a year and still in great shape Even the laces are in good shape Very durable great sport shoe good looking  great quality perfect fit The shoe has held up relatively well The shoes are lightweight and material is pretty tough I give three out of five stars because of the toe  better reinforcement of the toes considering little boys play hard soccer during recess and the toes of shoes need to hold up more than two weeks to soccer ball kicks My daughter loves the color light pink with the grey fits well looks great Super cute but too narrow my son loves it Perfect Great These shoes are great I had been looking for a pair of shoes that fit my feet and were comfortable for months I had been everywhere I could think of to try and find a pair even went to store to try shoes on all with no luck Then I found these shoes they fit great it will be the first pair of shoes in years that dont break open on the sides for me and on top of that I was able to wear them right out of the box day 1 and they were comfortable Im on my feet a good amount of the day and wear these shoes for 1214 hours a day and at the end of the day my feet dont hurt and I have noticed less back and leg pain since wearing these shoes I liked them so much I turned around and purchased a 2nd pair in a different color and those are just as amazing I would highly recommend these shoes I have owned many different pairs of the ASICS GelNimbus Shoes over the years and have never been disappointed with the feel performance and look of these shoes Cant beat the price that I purchased this new ASICS Mens GelNimbus 21 Running Shoes at Very Happy Got here fast Nice and comfortable shoe I wear a 95 and they fit perfectly Thanks Good running sneaker They are soooo comfortable and stable Forget about Nike I strongly recommend ASICS Iâ\\x80\\x99m very satisfied with the purchase Was delivered fast Super cool Christmas gift for my son the runner This was a gift for someone Ive had a lot of Romas over time They are great But be sure to get a half a size larger than usual I love the color and how it fits on my 3 year old son Would be purchasing another puma Roma I delivery was faster than I expected Love loving this shoes ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 Loving these shoes just as image My son loves this sneakers It is good to know that if there were to be a problem that I could easily return  With that being said all went well and they fit exactly as expected  They were suppose to be for school but we had to try them out  Perfect My son loves this sneakers  he is wearing it all day long It was a great fit Fast delivery from USA

Schule bei uns am Montag wieder Ã¶ffnet mussten schnell neue Hausschuhe her da mein Sohn aus seinen bisher genutzten herausgewachsen istWichtig war mir vor Allem das der neue Hausschuh atmungsaktiv

customerPS for capezio tap shoes you have to know your perfect size before ordering el producto esta buen estado y llego a venezuela como se ve en la foto referencial gracia buen vendedor lo felicito I think there is a big problem with the way this shoe is sized I am not convinced that this shoe can be fit to a womans footI ordered and tried 3 different sized pairs The last one that I decided to keep and wear caused me very large and painful heel blisters after 20 minutes of dancing Of course now that they are used I cannot return 300 lossI think you would do better with a cheaper shoe My Blochs never caused these problems The shoes that were in the box were the wrong size a 13 12 not 12 as stated in the ad Lammfell innen echtes Leder auÃ\\x9fen wasserfest und sieht auch noch toll aus Meine Tochter liebt diese Stiefel Die Schuhe sind zwar leider nicht sooooo weich zu knicken wie unsere Sommerschuhe aber fÃ¼r Herbstwinterstiefel sind sie perfekt Robust und trotzdem schick This shoe looks good but doesnt feel good They made a sore ð\\x9f\\x98© on my heel Im sticking with adidas It is comfortable and nice a good buy The back of the shoe is high and rubs blisters Sehr bequemer und schÃ¶ner SchuhIch schwanke immer zwischen 38 und 39 Hier hat mir 39 gepasst Buen articulo esta marca me va bien Be careful there is no realistic return policy I like in FL and they want 100 to return The shoes I received are not the same shoes pictured The shoes pictured had a velcro strap closure The shoes I received appear to have the same lower body however they have  lace closures Disappointing Sooouu4 month old shoes Cute bright fit as expected Ive owned new balance before and have always been happy with the brand These did not hold up My daughter barely wore them because she has many shoes I just now realized how worn they look In these 4 months these shoes have never been washed or cleaned demonstrating they truly are still new and you can see the soles are barely worn but very torn and worn on the fabric side Pictures attached for you to use your own judgement En asfalto se comportan como un guante These are fantastic shoes for my seven year old  He loves them  We ordered the white ones which turned out having pinklavenderishNs on them  I pulled out a black Sharpie and changed that before my son saw  Lol  These plastic toggles on the laces have not held up  One is completely gone already with another hanging by a thread  Not sure why  Great grip  Easy to wipe clean I purchased these for my daughter who wears a 25 They arrived today and she had the hardest time putting them on When I tried I did as well but succeeded She said they were way too tight and hurt her foot As far as appearance they are nice looking but you may need to order half a size up or even wide for your kiddo we never had to buy wide for her shoes Fit as expected however these have shown wear rather quickly They do not tighten around my daughterâ\\x80\\x99s ankles well so they rub together throughout the day as they are sticking out a bit She says then are comfortable shoes they just didnâ\\x80\\x99t stay looking nice as long as I expected She started wearing these late August so this is less than 4 months of wear My son has wide feet and normally has a least half an inch of toe room in a size 11 However these shoes fit just right I bought a wide and the shoe was snug on his foot as well with thin socks I am returning for a larger size since I love the quality Pictures do not do it justice Buy the shoe but go for a larger size and XW if your child has a wide foot My son is kind of particular about how his shoes look But I picked these out without him and he loved them The basic color is great since he wears them every day He says theyre comfortable I bought them a little big for him to grow into but they still work well for him So far the quality is good Well see in a few more months but I have high hopes I got these for my 5  12 year old so take that into consideration when he says they are the best shoes heâ\\x80\\x99s ever worn ð\\x9f\\x98\\x84I like the fact that I could get a pair of classic trainers for him in extra wide 3rd paid of NBs for him and will continue to do so We bought these for my elementary son to run cross country  They are well made but do not offer as much support as some of the other options out there  They will serve our purposes for this season but I will likely choose something with more support next time I bought this for my boy and they came to large On top of that its described as girls shoes  and I donâ\\x80\\x99t  Find them very girly Decent looking UNISEX shoes that I hope my son will wear in near future Scarpe super comode e ancora piÃ¹ belle che da foto Al tatto il leopardato sembra pelo

feeta bit tight across the toes but they will break in They are so cute and very comfortable Perfect warm waterproof boot for kids in the snow The liner to the boot runs VERY SMALL My toddler is a size 5 I ordered a 6 and the boot is big but the liner is tiny and very narrow The width of the liner is seriously that of a newborn shoe Itâ\\x80\\x99s that narrow and small Her foot WILL NOT fit into it Forget trying to put a foot with socks on it into the boot Iâ\\x80\\x99m seriously debating on returning these if the liner is unusable and the boots wonâ\\x80\\x99t keep her feet warm without it Without the liner itâ\\x80\\x99s essentially a fancy rainboot there is zero integrated paddingwarmth into the boot

My son is 22 months and the liner was WAY too narrow for his foot  Even taking the liner out and trying to get just that on him before trying the boot on I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t able to get his toes past the middle of the liner  It was quite literally HALF the width of his wide little baby foot  They were also very heavy and clunky so if we could have gotten them on I imagine they would have been difficult for him to walk in While Im sure these are warm  I love Columbia these boots are much too clumpy for a toddler My one year old loves to walk  run but in these boots she can hardly lift her feet so insists on being carried even when just testing them in the house Might be fine for an older child but I would go with Lands End in that case anyway I really wanted these boots to work So much so that I ignored the other reviews and tried them anyway The inside liner is not just small but bunches up making it impossible to get a foot into them In addition to that the shaft is so stiff it makes it challenging to get it past the ankle I love everything Columbia and theyâ\\x80\\x99re a trusted brand but Iâ\\x80\\x99m so super bummed by these Probably great but too hard to get on their feet After about the third time I just didnt want to do it again so they just sat there I got the kamiks and they slip right on perfect fit These fit well but you almost have to break your kids leg to get them in them The liner in this boot is just cheap foam Does not even seem like it will keep a childâ\\x80\\x99s feet warm My son is a toddler size 5 thatâ\\x80\\x99s what was purchased I cannot even get his foot down into the boot because they are so tight even at the ankle My son loves these They are very good quality I never have a problem with any Columbia product that I purchase These boots are great They fit as expected and they are sturdy They have held up to little boy ruff and tuff play No matter how long they have been out or how wet the snow has been their feet come out dry There has even been some complaints of hot feet Which is a great thing in my book Great quality Sturdy boots My son can DESTROY any pair of boots or shoes in a week he has many many times But these have held up well to the abuse they take on a daily basis Never hear conplaints about cold piggies This is a well built lightweight waterproof shoe Im a size 13 and it feels just a tad bit small These shoes took a long while to break in to the point where I almost gave up on them which would have been a shame considering the price About a month in wearing them once a day for a walk Im at the point where I feel they are a good quality walking shoe now that theyre broken in So far theyve kept water out during light rain and small puddles Great Son muy buenos y sÃºper cÃ³modos son una belleza ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 Muy buen articulo Muy lindos y sÃºper cÃ³modosa mi esposa le encantaron Muy cÃ³modos First off I had no problems with the seller or shipping The problem with these shoes was that the toes have an angular design that caused my toes to get uncomfortably squeezed and they seem to run small too The angle didnt look too sharp in the picture but it definitely feels too sharp This was my first time trying womens puma shoes do I didnâ\\x80\\x99t really know what to expect and had to return these My 11 year old granddaughter loves these sneakers They are stylish and Puma makes great athletic shoes I bought two pairs Just as comfy as I was hoping theyâ\\x80\\x99d be and they look great Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten compliments from guys and girls I like the color schemes  cushions in soles They fit just right and look really nice Shoes was dirty and it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t what I was expected Also it looks as though it was wore before and partially cleaned up with white shoe polish added I am very disappointed EstÃ¡n muy bonitos pero si me gustarÃ\\xada que tuvieran mÃ¡s memory fom Pero de allÃ\\xad estan muy bien Muchas gracias Sobre todo por quÃ© soy una persona que tengo

comfortable at the same time Also light to walk for awhile Nice shoe buthow has no one mentioned how small they are Son wears size 8 We ordered the 8 naturally They were absurdly small We sent them back got 9â\\x80\\x99s They too are crazy small The Nike in the pic is a size 8 NB a size 9 The quality is great but these run VERY small I wear a 55 in womenâ\\x80\\x99s but went with a 6 Tried them on and within a few seconds couldnâ\\x80\\x99t feel my toes because theyâ\\x80\\x99re so tight Iâ\\x80\\x99ll need to go up to a 65 at least and that has never happened These were too narrow and tight even when going up one full size Impossible to get on since there is no tongue that opens up to put the fiitin easier  We will be returning these  Disappointed Light Runs a full size smaller than

delivery  Keep up the good work Tres bonne qualitÃ© Most comfortable shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever bought wish there were more in my size Very good quality Great  Been wearing this brand exclusively for 8 years and I appreciate the comfort these shoes provide The are sleek enough for formal meetings and casual enough for classroom teaching I always look for the best price as Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s are expensive which I why I got this pair  I usually get them at Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s I wear these 5 days a week 10 hours a day and they last almost all year with only the sole wearing out Note I do maintain them weekly by cleaning and polishing which probably helps the lasting look and feel of the uppers Not clarcks  it came in unsturctured brand boxEven clarcks not graved on shoes Used wardrobe to try on a few pairs of slip ons as I wear them for work These are comfortable and fit just right It was up between these or the hush puppies Ultimately went with these to try and was not diappointed Excellent quality Beautiful shoe Son preciosos pero tuve que devolverlos porque estaban grandes Dieser Stiefel wÃ¼rde sogar 1000 von mir bekommen Ich habe gar nicht so viel erwartet aufgrund des ausgesprochen gÃ¼nstigen Preises Aber  Er ist wunderschÃ¶n Passt perfekt ist robust und wirklich sehr zu empfehlen Ich habe sehr schmale Waden und hÃ¤tte mir wahrscheinlich ein sondermaÃ\\x9f anfertigen lassen mÃ¼ssen aber wer schlank ist und auch schmale Waden hat wird sich Ã¼ber diesen Stiefel wirklich freuen  Dieser Reisstiefel sieht wirklich gut aus Leider ist er an den Waden extrem schmal geschnitten Ich habe diese Stiefel fÃ¼r meine 12jÃ¤hrige sehr schlanke Tochter bestellt Selbst sie hat den Stiefel oben am Druckknopf nicht zu bekommen Weil sie diese aber unbedingt wollte hat der Schumacher unseres Vertrauens den Druckknopf versetzt so dass sie letztendlich rein passte Sehr hoher Schaft somit auch nicht passend fÃ¼r KinderUnd leider viel zu klein Ich bin 163 und wiege 57kg also ganz normale Statur Habe auch keine dicken Waden dennoch habe ich die Stiefel gerade mal bis zur Achillessehne zu bekommen Sie sehen wunderschÃ¶n aus sind aber nur was fÃ¼r wirklich sehr schlanke Beine Artikel geht zurÃ¼ck Ein Schein fÃ¼r den Kostenlosen rÃ¼ckversandt lag bei Versuche jetzt nochmal die Stiefel in der kurzenweiten Variante Leider bin ich ziemlich enttÃ¤uscht FÃ¼r kleinere Kids vielleicht ok Das das nicht echtes Leder ist war mir ja schon vorher klar aber das sind einfach Gummistiefel  Anders kann ich es leider nicht beschreiben An sich sehen sie ganz gut aus aber am FuÃ\\x9f nein tut mir leid Wenn man lÃ¤uft sacken sie richtig ein Unten breit und oben eng dass der Knopf fast nicht zu ging PS  Sind wie ich meine die gleichen wie die bei KrÃ¤mer fÃ¼r 80 â\\x82¬

lui laisser le temps de se former Ã\\xa0 votre piedJe suis ravie davoir trouvÃ© des bottes parfaites pour les personnes de petite taille qui nÃ©cessitent une tige courte et un tour de mollet mince tout en ayant une pointure de taille 38Je suis satisfaite de mon achat et je recommande ces bottes Compre unas botas de montar y las he devuelto porque eran grandesNo me ha gustado nada haber tenido que pagar 43â\\x82¬ de gastos de devoluciÃ³n en correos Me parece alucinante y un autÃ©ntico robo Ottimo prodotto molto comodo lunica cosa Ã¨ che alla caviglia restano appena abbondanti Super schÃ¶ne Schuhe An manchen stellen drÃ¼cken sie leider ein bissel am Anfang aber jetzt geht es Ich habe super tollen halt auf meinem Pferd und ich wÃ¼rde sie immer wieder kaufen  Dopo due tentativi sono finalmente riuscito ad individuare la taglia corretta Ottimo prodotto consigliato Ottimo prodotto They are very soft you can tell its good quality Id say though that they look more sporty in real life than in the pictures I bit like football shoes if that makes sense Still happy with the quality and the material UtilisÃ©es pour le Tai chi la semelle caoutchouc amortit vraiment trÃ¨s bien les chaussures accrochent bien au sol mais permettent aussi de glisser les pieds pour les mouvements qui le nÃ©cessitentTrÃ¨s bonne qualitÃ© et confortLa couleur claire fait que je les porte plus Ã\\xa0 lintÃ©rieur en salle quÃ\\xa0 lextÃ©rieur die Schuhe sind schÃ¶n warm aber leider etwas klobig Aber zum spazierengehen mit dem Hund ok Muy cÃ³modas y calientitas Cute but the cut of these did not work for me returned  The insole was cushiony but the shape of the boot made it uncomfortable to walk in  Also the top of the boot has a large opening which is good for accommodating different sizes but it slides around unless you cinch it all the way with the laces which I think will crease the material over time and also just felt kind of weird  I would like to see this concept redesigned since it is a cute style but just fits really strangely sizing up or down wouldnt have helped and did not feel very practical I was so DISAPPOINTED that these walking shoes would NOT allow me to slide my foot inside  Im 66 yrs old and walk my 82 lb dog twice a day  These shoes looked like the perfect footwear for light snowfall days  HAH The opening at the top is too narrow and rigid  There are no gussets that allow the opening to widen and accomodate your heel and ankle  Very POOR design   Because of that I cannot comment on the fit or comfort  I had high hopes for these  The tread on the bottom of the shoe and the ankle support would have made this a very stable shoeboot I really like these boots but I just wish they were a little bit more comfortable I had to return my regular size and get a half size bigger because they definitely run small I did keep the 7 12 because they are easy to wear and get around in in the city but I find that my heel to slip out just a little bit even with my orthotics inside I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I would wear them every day but the days that I do with them they are pretty comfortable Looked nicehad to return too small Could not get my foot all the way in the shoe No side zipper or opening at the shoe laces to open up the shoe I was unable to put my foot in the shoe Returned immediately Warm Look good However the soles make my ankles legs and knees bend in I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be wearing them because of knee arthritis Love new balance sneakers and was hoping these would be equally good Nice boots Devo dire che esiste un rapporto di amoreodio con me e questo specifico marchioI prodotti sono eccellenti la qualitÃ\\xa0 costruttiva ottima ma ogni volta che decido di acquistare qualcosa di questo marchio finisco sempre per restituirloCONFEZIONE bella e originale completa di tutte le sue carte protettive sia interne che esterneMATERIALI E QUALITAâ\\x80\\x99Allâ\\x80\\x99interno troviamo le scarpe e li notiamo subito la qualitÃ\\xa0 costruttiva e dei materiali La pelle Ã¨ fantastica le cuciture e sono impeccabili Allâ\\x80\\x99interno della scarpa sotto al tallone e sul lato interno troviamo un piccolo â\\x80\\x9cspessoreâ\\x80\\x9d in gomma che permette al piede di non affaticarsiPREZZO se prese con le giuste offerte riuscite a risparmiare anche il 70 rispetto al negozioLâ\\x80\\x99unico diffeto di queste scarpe sono le taglie CONTROLLATE BENE LE TAGLIE Come giaâ\\x80\\x99 detto io le ho spedite indietro piÃ¹ volte anche cambiando taglia ma non ho mai trovato quelle adatte a me Inoltre le foto sono davvero fatte male e non consentono di capire bene lo stile della scarpa e come potrebbero stare ai propri piediCONCLUSIONI Le consiglio come qualitÃ\\xa0 costruttiva e dei materiali ma non ho avuto il piacere di poterle indossare nemmeno 1 ora e provare il loro fantastico design e comoditÃ The shoes were delivered in an ordinary unbranded box as if some local shopkeeper has send them the quality of shoes is bad and I doubt if its pure leather material or else also not sure if its original Clarks product  Im in two minds if should retain or return it La misura Ã¨ fedele a quella reale forse la punta si allunga un po piÃ¹ del solito ma ritengo sia il modello  Controllo QualitÃ\\xa0 da rivedere non si assembla una scarpa quando la suola in gomma presenta bolle e dunque irregolaritÃ\\xa0 che soprattutto sulla punta di una scarpa classica sono fastidiose da vedere Ho comprato queste scarpe durante unofferta ad prezzo speciale 20â\\x82¬Le scarpe sono di buone qualitÃ\\xa0 e si presentano bene Forse mi aspettavo qualcosa in piÃ¹ a livello della qualitÃ\\xa0 della pelle ma per il prezzo sono davvero ottime La misura corrisponde fedelmente a quella che porto di solito Che belle qualitÃ\\xa0 buona e anche il colore molto bello la pelle certo si vede che non Ã¨ la migliore ma a quel prezzo cmq sono meravigliosamente comode Scarpe comode La suola Ã¨ fatta in un materiale che Ã© impermeabile all acqua Il numero corrisponde a quello reale Molto comode ottimo confort cuscinetto morbido al plantare e al tallone buonr finiture in pelle The shoe seemed like a cheap road side product Forma molto bella qualita della pelle non Ã¨ un granchÃ© morbida Belle scarpe ma quelle che sono arrivate a me avevano la suola deformata Molto belli e comodi Schnelle Liefe und Preis auch iOrung ces chaussures ne tiennent pas le piedla longueur est bonne mais impossible de serrer les laniÃ¨res afin que le pied soit bien tenu Estaba especialmente feliz de recibir este modelo ya que como es importado espere varios dÃ\\xadas y oh sorpresa Talla equivocada Es la segunda vez que me pasa en productos de importaciÃ³n Lo tuve que regresar  El modelo estÃ¡ sÃºper bonito  I do workout videos several times a week  I like to make sure that my shoes can stand up to all the moves  These shoes fit perfectly and are great to workout in  I love the longer tongue on the shoesI know that sounds funny but they protect the ankle area more than most shoes do Comfy love it nan Value for money Buen producto muy cÃ³modos el material se ensucia con facilidad es como tipo gamuza QuizÃ¡s lo Ãºnico serÃ\\xada que para mÃ\\xad vienen anchos los Tennis puesto que son amplios de la punta Pero en general estÃ¡n bonitos me gustaron ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82ð\\x9f\\x91\\x9flike like like Le scarpe che ho acquistato sono comodissime e di ottimo materiale Le scarpe sono perfettamente corrispondenti alla descrizione e allimmagine della pagina di amazon Great sneakers  look great thank you Why are athletic shoe companies putting these weird things under the soul Is it supposed to be a gel pad or what Instead of making the shoe more comfortable it makes the shoe less comfortable Please just give us a nice smooth insole  Donâ\\x80\\x99t put these gel pads in there because they donâ\\x80\\x99t work and we can feel them so it defeats the purpose  If itâ\\x80\\x99s not a gel pad I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what it is But itâ\\x80\\x99s a horizontal lump going from left to right under the ball of the foot area Also I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the toe area too pointy prefer more rounded I was worried bc multiple reviews said these run large and order down a size but I wear a 5 which is the smallest size They fit fine though and feel nice These are exactly as described Reebok is the best I ordered an 85 and they fit perfectly This shoe is a knock off The printed logo Reebok is supposed to be in the white part of the back area above ankle as seen in picture 1 above Notice pic 2 doesnt have it For 65 its a ripoff I wasnt sure if I would like these shoes because I couldnt find many written reviews Ive searched the internet for a nice comfy white sneaker to go with every outfit I didnt want to spend a ton definitely not over 100 I found these and prayed they would fit right and not hurt my feet and also look good They are super cute and fit very well Ive always been in between a 9 and 9 12 I never really know what size to get I went for a 9 and they fit wonderfully They are very comfortable  and Im excited to wear them with every outfit and not ruin my feet These shoes are very light weight softly cushioned and very comfortable for all day wear I got a half size bigger just because but I think itâ\\x80\\x99s okay to order true to size Got a pair for my friend also bought true to size and they fit her great Easy to clean also I just use a wet wipe after I get home for any marks or smudges Taglia corrisponde ho usate per una gita in citta e devo dire che sono comode Ein sehr schicker und bequemer Schuh GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt perfekt SchÃ¶n und bequem Feder leicht und sehen einfach schick aus Die Schuhe kann man mit allem kombinieren Ich finde das Material etwas fester es kÃ¶nnten unschÃ¶ne DruckstellenBlasen am FuÃ\\x9f oben entstehen Und da der Schuh einen LackÃ¼berzug hat kÃ¶nnte ggf und schÃ¶ne FaltenKnickstellen entstehen noch habe ich die Schuhe nicht ausgefÃ¼hrt und kann dazu nichts sagen ist nur eine Vermutung Da ich die Schuhe fÃ¼r ca 32â\\x82¬ im Angebot gekauft habe die schick aussehen beim Probelauf zu Hause mega bequem und federleicht sind hab ich die trotzdem behalten Gebe jedoch auf Grund der oben aufgefÃ¼hrten Punkte insg 4 Sterne Ich hoffe ich war hilfreichNachtrag nun hatte ich die Schuhe einen Tag lang an und habe wie befÃ¼rchtet Blasen bekommen Deshalb nur noch 2 Sterne von ursprÃ¼nglich 4 Sterne 1 Stern fÃ¼r das geringe Gewicht federleicht und 1 Stern fÃ¼r das Aussehen sehen einfach super schÃ¶n aus und die Farbe ist mega jedoch bringt das alles nix wenn die Schuhe hinterher Blasen bescheren Also keine Kaufempfehlung Ein toller Schuh leicht passgenau sehr bequem  und auch optisch sehr ansprechend ich trage den Schuh nun ein paar Tage und bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Kauf Sehr auffÃ¤llig chic mit dem Bugatti  Schriftzug Wie nach MaÃ\\x9f Laufen sich super und leicht Incredibly light weight and comfortableNice quality and design Ich besitze schon einige Schuhe von Bugatti und bin wie immer sehr zufrieden Mein Wunsch erfÃ¼llt 8 Die Sneakers sind sehr schÃ¶n und tolle Innensohle Empfehlenswert ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Very comfortable recommended Ich habe Gr 375 und bestelle immer Gr 38 Diese Schuhe passen mir in Gr 37 sind wunderschÃ¶n und bequem WÃ¼rde mir am liebsten noch mehr Farben bestellen DNachtrag Meine Kollegin und ich haben noch mal zugeschlagen Sie hat einen breiteren FuÃ\\x9f Gr 37 und hat daher die Gr 38 genommen WunderschÃ¶ne Farben und sehr gute Verarbeitung Ganz tolle und bequeme Stiefelchen mit beidseitigen ReiÃ\\x9fverschluss das erleichtert das HinschlÃ¼pfen sehr Ein wunderschÃ¶ner Sommer Schuh Sieht original noch besser aus als auf den Bildern Bin sehr zufrieden ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d SchÃ¶ner bequemer Schuh ich trage GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 37 und hab viel Platz Einziger Kritikpunkt der Schaft ist etwas weit  Artikel gefÃ¤llt mir gut Genauso wie in der Beschreibung  PÃ¼nktlich Lieferung Sehr schÃ¶n Awsome comfortable light shoes Wanted to buy this product for both casual and slightly smart casual wear but the material isnt really good for smart casual wear so it sort of defeated my purpose for buying it The Mens Street Encounter series are much better and the material used also more formal and suitable for smart casual wear Shoes are overall quite light and easy to wear but it simply didnt fit my purposes Would recommend for casual wear though Too too small I have wide feet but I even had my daughter and granddaughter try them who wear a size 8 they both said they fit like a 6 Light and comfortable love them Le ho prese per la mia bimba di 11 mesi che giÃ\\xa0 cammina le stanno perfette Molto flessibili comode da indossare Anche per il grande ho preso delle Puma le ritengo le migliori soprattutto in qualitÃ\\xa0prezzo QualitÃ\\xa0prezzo Sono carine e corrispondono al proprio numero J adore tout Ã\\xa0 fait ce que je voulais pour la rentrÃ©e de ma fille je recommande vivement ces chaussures I lacci sono elastici e tendono ad allentarsi ma mi sembra una buona scarpa che sostiene la caviglia adatta anche a chi ha bisogno di inserire i plantari The media could not be

producto Producto sobrepaso las expectativas 100 recomendado These are a little fancier than I would send my kid to school inThey are more like a fancy occasion Sunday church holiday or just an â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t find my sneakersâ\\x80\\x9d day it happensI was anxious about the â\\x80\\x9cslip onâ\\x80\\x9d as sometimes this style is actually harder to get on kidâ\\x80\\x99s limp feet as they donâ\\x80\\x99t tend to push their foot in to help you out at all when trying to get the shoes on I was surprised that my kid could actually get these on all by himself and without any socks to ease the way to boot Iâ\\x80\\x99m pleased that the elastic panels built in actually stretch enough so the kids can get their foot inThe quality of these is really good They look and feel like a high quality menâ\\x80\\x99s shoe just in a mini me kidâ\\x80\\x99s size This is a great shoe to match Dad inMy kid was so excited about his new shoes he ran errands around town in them the day he got themCanâ\\x80\\x99t wait for him to wear these to picture day etcOverall Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend them Pros1 They work well for almost any occasion2 Comfortable my son has no complaints and gives them a big thumbs up3 They look very nice in person very happy with the styleCons1 They are showing very slight signs of wear after a month but to be fair my child is very active2 The materials used for these shoes arenâ\\x80\\x99t bad but also not high grade eitherOverall these are a great pair of shoes There is a little room for improvement but overall Iâ\\x80\\x99m happy with them and i would definitely get them again I love that these have the utility of a sneaker but can slip on easily without my child needing to tie the shoes or mess with velcro straps  Very well made durable child shoe  My child feels comfortable in them and has never complained about wearing them he would be barefoot all the time if that were an option They dry faster than most of his other shoeswhich is helpful because he refuses to put on a wet shoeand I dont blame him  Worth the extra expense for its functionality and ease of putting on My 6 year old likes these  Theyre comfortable and easy to slip on they have good stretch to fit over his foot Theyre lightweight tooThey appear to be a wellmade and attractive shoe  No loose threads or wonky stitching  Theyre cute for summer with a pair of shorts but they would dress up nicely with a pair of khakisIm very happy with these I would definitely recommend I like these shoes a lot I got them for my son he needs a little more growing to do though i like to get them big so he can used them as much as possible They are very soft on the inside lots of cushion for the back of the heal I can tell they are well made with hight quality materials and are flexible slip resistance for outdoor activities all day long Genuine leather is always a plus for any kind of shoes theyre so much more durable These are of a high enough quality that we will easily be able to pass them on to our youngest when our older son is done with them Easy to slip on and off and the elastic at the shoes opening helps with wider feet Looks great with jeans and little boy khaki pants I like the look of these shoes and they seem to be high quality I think theyre a great casual look   nicer than sneakers without being too formal or grownup My son says theyre one of the most comfortable pairs hes ever owned Both of us enjoy the ease of them being slipon My 7yearold loves these shoes They are casual enough for everyday wear but also nice enough when he needs to dress up a bit They fit and feel like sneakers but look like loafers Great shoes for an active little guy Schuhe wurden schnell geliefert Leider waren rote EinfÃ¤rbungen auf dem StoffDaher habe ich die Schuhe gleich wieder zurÃ¼ckgeschickt Everyone has Birkenstocks and I wanted something a little different and I love Sorel shoes so I gave these a try  They are super comfortable and cute though I have wide feet and this style is not flattering to my specific feet  But I dont care  We are living through a pandemic and I want comfort  And I can see beyond the ugliness of my feet to appreciate the beauty of these shoes  Highly recommend  Fit true to size Great shoes The quality is high But Produkt is too largeThe size indicated on the package 445 31 cm will suit you if your foot size is 46 Didnâ\\x80\\x99t like them as much at first Gave me bad blisters kind of slid off almost returned them But now I wear them all of the time Great support I bought these as a gift and the person I got them for loves them She says they fit perfectly according to her size and are sturdy Of course theyre sturdy theyre Sorels Size up 12 size 9 fits just like 8 12 Very cute and comfy Leather will stretch a bit Very happy with this Sorel purchase Comfortable TTS good quality Attractive good sale price and comfy Per ben due volte ho dovuto restituire larticolo Ordinato il n 42 ma Ã¨ arrivato il 41 Per la prima restituzione col cambio articolo ho parlato anche con unoperatrice amazon per essere sicuro mi venisse sostituito con la taglia giusta ma nulla da fare  la sostituzione Ã¨ stata fatta sempre con taglia errata The sandal did not grip my foot I had a difficult time walking in them Had to return Muy buena pinta suela blandita pero demasiado pequeÃ±o Talo 41 comprÃ© 41 y es pequeÃ±o lo devuelvo Desastre total No tienen ni dos meses y apenas los he usado y ya estÃ¡n despegados o rotos por el talÃ³n Belle e comode mio figlio ne Ã¨ soddisfatto Ottime Sneakers calzano bene e la suola interna Ã¨ molto comodo Preciosos Ordinato 425 Ricevuto 41Pero lo stile colore e qualitÃ\\xa0 sono top Per questo due e non solo una stella bellissime scarpe davvero comoda e molto minimal stile element nice Excelente producto Las zapatillas son muy bonitas pero es la segunda vez que intento comprarlas y se equivocan con la talla These may fit if I hope on to them in two or three years I was really shocked at the size  They were like 5 inches to long  I had ordered one size up so went to different company ordered the size and is 12 and perfect fit Little roomy and perfect Will be sending them back if I dont miss window I was just shocked how huge  I should have read the comments My little one cried and cried  They folded when she tried to walk in them  It was like watching her walk in my shoes I bought these for our grandaughter she wears them all the time  The boots are super cute and of high quality They are  not a  cheap build like most I have seen at our local target stores Well worth the money especially if you have another younger  child who can wear  them after their sibling is done with them Beautiful boots but be aware they are very heavy  I bought them for my two year old granddaughter  She can barely lift them  A larger size for older kids would probably be ok like a 5 year old might be able to handle them in their size  But not ideal for toddlers My 2 yr old granddaughter absolutely loves these boots These are the only shoes she wants to wear She can put them on and take them off by herself They are well made Easy to keep clean You just wipe them off My toddler is really a 5 but I wanted her to be able to put these on and off herself so I expected them to be big and they were She loves them and has been wearing them around the house Itâ\\x80\\x99s raining today so it should be interesting to see how she likes them outside My daughter loves these  They are a bit larger than expected which is fine Gives her room to grow We live in Phoenix so it doesnt rain often but shes thrilled to run and jump in muddy puddles and not ruin her good shoes My daughter loves these These are perfect for little guys to pull on with the handles We bought a coat and umbrella to match as well Cant wait to jump in puddles They run a little big but they are really cute my niece wears a size ten in toddler and these boots in size ten slipped right on and off her foot making it kinda hard for her to walk because of the looseness These boots were a Christmas gift for my 2  year old granddaughter  She wears a size 8 and these were roomy however she walks fine in them VERY cute boots and she loves them Theses boots have been worn ALOT since Christmas and still look super cute after being cleaned My granddaughter loved these rain boots Sheâ\\x80\\x99s three and loves Mickey and Minnie Mouse Perfect gift Klare Kaufempfehlung passt sitzt und hat Luft  Sehr bequem man hat das GefÃ¼hl barfuÃ\\x9f zu laufen These shoes were perfect  I got mine as a Christmas present and am so happy with them They do run slightly larger than your actual size so size down a half size These are authentic because I keep seeing people asking The ones with the serial numbers on them thats the style of those ones For some reason Adidas decided to leave those like that You can look at the actual Adidas website and you can cross reference those specific colorsstyles and you will see that they have serial numbers on them from the actual website as well  These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes Ive ever worn they are the best I forgot to write a review on this item however I got these a couple months ago for my sister and she loved them Not only did she say they were comfortable but they are also very stylish They fit her nice and she loved them i got 105 like i always do with adidas shoes but had to return for the 10 and its still semi too large  Not the most comfortable but they do look nice  Probably wont work out in these as i expected to be able to due to that I know these shoes run large buy a 5 size down  I get lots of compliments on these These are beautiful I have one other pair in this style so I know they run large I recommend sizing down one size Im normally a size 8 in womens but these i ordered a 7 and they fit perfect Lightweight and comfortable Love the color absolutely love these didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to pay full price for these shoes and they are perfect The shoes were a gift and they loved it Perfect gift Cute and functional all in one  Recommend  Run a little big Go half a size down Las zapatillas vienen en caja

balanceOjo no cometas el mismo error que yo pidelas de tu nÃºmero yo las pedi un numero mÃ¡s grande y no era necesario vienen muy amplias Country of origin  These sandals are made in VietnamFinish  These appear to be injection molded so even though they might ultimately cracktear but they should be somewhat more reliable than the glued onesFit  Very narrow width extremely tight My shoe size is 105 Medium width for my New Balance 990 series Since these sandals do NOT come in half sizes I ordered these New Balance sandals in Size 11 Medium width Result  Very NARROW WIDTH and the fit is extremely tight and uncomfortable Pretty disappointing Not sure what size chart they used when manufacturing these but it surely isnt the same chart for fitting the NB 990 seriesConclusion  If you are going to order these might want to keep the caveat about narrow width in consideration Theyre sandals  not much else to say The fit and color are as advertised Decent value for money if bought on sale although I probably wouldnt pay full price for them These are great sandles  bout them for running out to the hot tub they seem good and durable  should last for years Aprietan un poco La caja vino algo aplastada pero es lo de menos lls zapatos estaban sin detalles me quedaron perfectamenteLos uso para entrenar box todos los dÃ\\xadas y si son duraderos Great quality and amazing comfortable CÃ³modos super diseÃ±o 100 satisfied After 1 match going all 3 min it is loosing the color coating on the toe of the shoe The black part is coming off and the red is showing throughjust 1 Match  This I am very disappointed about Bought my son the solid black ones last season and they did great That is what ultimately made me decide to purchase these this season for him However for 10700 I expected to get a solid shoe that would take wear better than 1 match My daughter got almost two seasons of wear out of these shoes We just bought another pair in a different color because the first pair is starting to wear out We feel this is a very acceptable amount of use She loves the way they feel Her womens shoes size is 758 and she wears a 65 in the Mat Wizard 4 Had to return these The started falling apart after four days of practice The tongue came completely off on one shoe and the toe stitching came apart on both shoes We have had kids wrestling for 10 years and have never had a pair of wrestling shoes that did not make it through one season These did not make it through 4 days which was a shame The shoes felt good and provided good traction on the mat Initially I was submitting a better review but i cannot honestly say theyre as good as wed like My son wears these for training and competitions He said theyre pretty comfortable but hes only had them for seven weeks and theyre looking ugly Theyre peeling and starting to come apart I really hoped because they were Adidas brand they would be better quality Now I feel embarrassed for him when he has to show up at a Tournament and the shoes look like hes had them for ages Not very wide and comfortable compared to size 12 asics with medium thickness wool socksAs One is cloth and the other is some newer molded stuffI wear thinner wool socks and fit snug Can wear all day during gym and errands comfortablyReally grippy  Just wish I could wear my normal wool socks True to size Very comfortable I use the at the gym for cardio and working the heavy bag Quality is solid One downside is that theyâ\\x80\\x99re not very breathable as my feet sweat in these shoes a lot Ottimo prodotto Fit exactly as expected  My high school son loves them and was able to wear them right out of the box  Highly recommend Sleek shoe Its a perfect fit for my son Very light shoe when my son outgrows it well buy another just like it This is a great starter spike My son loves the feel how lightweight it is great shoes Great pair of track shoes They held up for the season and then some Would definitely buy again Lovem Nachdem ich in allen Schuh und SportgeschÃ¤ften nach Badeschuhen gesucht habe und alle im Spann viel zu niedrig waren sind wir auf diese Schuhe gestossen Wir haben sie 3 Wochen in BachlÃ¤ufen Korsikas getestet und fÃ¼r gut befunden Man kommt super leicht rein durch die Schnur kann man ihn passend machen und bequem waren sie auchAllerdings muss man sie wirklich  wie schon beschrieben  mind eine Nummer kleiner nehmen Ich trage eine klassische 39 und habe sie in 38 bestellt und fÃ¼r meinen Sohn auch 1 Nummer kleiner Daumen hoch Die Schuhe sind hochwertig verarbeitet und laut meinem Sohn auch sehr bequemDiese Badeschuhe fallen zwar grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer aus aber mit dem Zugband lÃ¤sst sich der Schuh noch einstellen Habe zwar gelesen dass man eine GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe kleiner bestellen sollte aber nachdem die Kinder schneller wachsen als der Schnittlauch im Garten wollte ich doch dass die Schuhe etwas lÃ¤nger halten Zudem sollten Sie nicht ZU eng sein wenn die Kinder rumlaufen und durch Hitze und Wasser die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe etwas grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer werdenNÃ¤chste Woche werden die Schuhe dann dem HÃ¤rtetest heiÃ\\x9fer Sand und Wellenspringen unterzogen  Mir waren die Badeschuhe besonders wichtig da wir da in Urlaub waren wo es nicht nur super weichen Sand gibt sondern auch Steine und gegebenenfalls auch die kleinen Fische auf die man nicht treten sollteDie Schuhe sind schnell an und auch wieder ausgezogen und auch leicht mit SÃ¼Ã\\x9fwasser wieder ausgespÃ¼ltWÃ¼rde ich immer wieder kaufen Sieht gut aus passt gut preis ist auch ok Deutlich weniger rutschen im Schwimmbad  Leider aber nach dem ersten tragen schon kaputt gegangen Der Riemen zum verstellen ist abgerissen Standard Schuhe die ich auch woanders bekomme Aber die QualitÃ¤t ist gut nur das reingehen mit den FÃ¼Ã\\x9fen nervt GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt QualitÃ¤t top Mein Sohn hat GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 31 die bestellte GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe Leider fÃ¤llt der Schuh derart groÃ\\x9f aus dass er den Badeschuh im Wasser vermutlich verlieren wÃ¼rde Dass ich jetzt die Kosten der RÃ¼cksendung immerhin 13 des Kaufpreises zu tragen habe ist Ã¤rgerlich 6 JÃ¤hriger mÃ¶chte in Kroatien Steinstrand Badeschuhe anziehen direkt gerissen  Gut Die Schuh ist schon sehr bequem und stabilFÃ¼r Felsen Ã¼berhaupt kein Problem gut gepolstertIch wÃ¼rde das hier weiter empfehlen I have worn many running shoes for my feet From walking to trail to running and I use this for everyday shoes too As a past New Balance wearer I did change brands to a different competitor but I welcome the opportunity to come back to New Balance The Mens VENTR V1 Running Shoes slipped on like a glove Silky sleek and fits like a glove Pampered my feet I wore the shoes around the house to get a good feel for it And one will know if the shoes will work within minutes I wore the shoes for about a day with no tiredness feet It felt that I wasnt wearing any shoes Sure am wearing in the house and it hasnt seen the outside terrain but I do highly recommend New Balance VENTR V1 Running Shoes to anyone looking for shoes that gives them the arch support great comforts for your feet and the price point to boot Los compre para reemplazar mis ya viejos tenis de ejercicio Cardio  estatico  la medida que pedi fue la adecuada  son muy comodos y acolchonados  mi ejercicio lo realizo sin problemas sin causar molestia o cansansio extra en la planta del pie  tambien los he utilizado para caminar distancias largas y son super comodos para esto  el precio fue una ganga cuando los compre El unico ojo es que hay que tener cuidado con la talla a adquirir Not the best surprise feat to try and pull off but I ended up buying these for my partners bday present He was shocked that I bought him running shoes but upon first look at them his eyes brightly widenedThese NB fit perfecttosize have been performing verywell for him as a light to moderate runner and the lookfeel of this shoe is sleek and versatileI try to wait a while prior to reviewing a purchase and so far approximately sixweeks in he is raving about this shoes performance feel and look Very sexy and comfortable shoe for running or dressing up jeans during the day or nightI wouldnt however buy this shoe today at the price I see listed A whopping CA120 more than what I paid Nuts After reading reviews a lot of people indicated the shoe fit smaller than it actually was and to be safe I ordered 12 larger  To be honest it was a big mistake the shoe to to larger  It would have been nice to actually get the proper size  CÃ³modos resistentes se ven y se sienten de calidad muy contento con la compra  tambiÃ©n los agarrÃ© en un excelente precio I have been using brooks and i am fine while walking long distances I tried these new balance shoes and feet started aching Will wear for another day and will change my review if its fine  Shoes look good La talla se ajusta a mi tamaÃ±o de pie No tengo problema alguno con ellos Me encantaron y considero que fue buena compra ya que lo agarre de oferta RelaciÃ³n calidad precio estÃ¡n muy bien son tenis bÃ¡sicos pero bien hechos Llegaron a tiempo  Excelentes justo lo que estaba esperando  Muy comfortables y se adaptan perfectamente al pie  Sin embargo hay que agregar media talla mÃ¡s ya que si no quedan muy justos Super cÃ³modos Muy a gusto la calidad de lo mejor En pocas palabras super contento con el producto por suerte los compre a un precio alrededor de 650 pesos These things are great I have been using water shoes for years for cycling kayaking and the gym they are also nice to drive in if you cant decide on a colour do as I did and get the pair with all of them ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a most arrive smelling like a chemical factory however these do not  My feet love them and they fit wonderfully  Very disappointed They fit properly however the toe part tore on the very first day of wearing them to an indoor waterpark My big toe was sticking out after getting out of the wave pool What a waste of money I cant wear these anymore They dont fit snug for use in the water The material looks nice and well made and they are cute Will look into getting a smaller pair Love these Fit perfectly and have a great sole They are good enough to wear around the pool deck to protect my feet from the heat and inside the pool my feet donâ\\x80\\x99t get torn up from the bottom of the pool its a public pool so I feel itâ\\x80\\x99s more sanitary tooI take water aerobics and theyâ\\x80\\x99re so comfortable I forget I have them on Love them Awesome little water shoes wore them camping wear ae were in and out of water swimming kayaking  tubing Most water shoes give me blisters  these didnt and I wore them for 5 days Threw them in wash when I got home  air dried good as new They run alittle tight but loosen up as you wear them Well worth the price Overall no complaints Bought to go river rafting Had no issues with them slipping off and didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel the roughness of the rocks We only did class 3 and belowThe sizes are a little tricky I would buy a size down to make sure they donâ\\x80\\x99t slip off These things are great With the price I thought maybe last 1 or 2 times on the riverNope I crashed 3 times first trip Kept my feet safe from rocks and when standing on rocks and mud my feet were secure and less muddy Ive used them every time I go kayaking They are a must I bought a pair for myself and for my husband They are great Three slipon hugs the foot very well and there is enough sole that protected the foot from broken sea shells while walking on the beach They are the best I have 5 pair I even have my husband wearing them he also loves them they are so comfortably can be warn with anything they are great Looked nice when they came but after two or three times in the pool they are coming apart I suppose these kinds of swim socks are good for light use they didnt hold up to active swimming and playing in the pool I was refunded My twoyearold grandson loves them doesnt want to take them off easy for him to put on and take off himself so that makes him feel awesome can I put a 34 warm because their summer sandals theyre not warm sandals but we really really love them theyre cute as can be Very cute Die Schuhe sind einfach top Mega leicht und sehr bequem und sehen klasse aus Allerdings sind sie fÃ¼r einen schmalen FuÃ\\x9f gedacht Gute QualitÃ¤t sauber verarbeitet ich bin superglÃ¼cklich sie sind viel schÃ¶ner als auf Fotos super bequem demnÃ¤chst bestelle ich mehr fÃ¼r die Familie Sehr gut ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Absolut toller Sneaker Gute Passform sehr leicht Loved the color loved the look and style of the sneaker but they tend to run narrow and short in toebox  So order at least 12 size up for best fit This is my third pair Love them  Pues confunde mucho la descripciÃ³n y el nombre Hydrotrekker Â¿por quÃ© Porque vas mojado como una hidra porque el empeine es de malla Vamos que las he devuelto Le scarpe sono perfette per nuotare e poi arrampicarsi sugli scogli hanno un ottima presa PerÃ² la suola si Ã¨ rovinata molto in fretta le ho usate su rocce di granito contenta con la compra  rÃ¡pido el envÃ\\xado  mÃ¡s bonitos en persona y lo mejor  son super cÃ³modos Gracias estou encantada There was a hole the mesh UPDATE I unfortunately had to reduce my review by 2 stars After just a few hikes the soles are falling apart Itâ\\x80\\x99s a shame because I really loved these shoesThese were sooooo comfortable right out of the box I get good traction and they handle getting wet very well Theyâ\\x80\\x99re pretty cute tooI should also mention that I typically wear an 8 and although the front of my foot is a normal width my heels are very narrow these shoes fit me very well in a 7 Â½ These worked great for my recent trip to Zion National Park for hiking through the Narrows  The shoe is comfortable and drains well  I did size down a half size but otherwise fit well  The shoes did take awhile to dry even though they drained well  They were comfortable to wear even without socks but did not offer much arch support  If I were to wear them when not hiking through water I would need to add a shoe insert to provide arch support  Overall worked great for what I needed them for and I will wear them again when hiking through rivers or tubing SuperschÃ¶ne Schuhe am Anfang wirkten sie etwas eng aber nach kurzer Gehzeit waren sie perfektIch trage normalerweise GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 37 und das sind 37er aber ich nehme ab nun an 1 GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe grÃ¶Ã\\x9ferBei allen MinnetonkaSchuhen hÃ¤tte ich lieber 1 GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer nehmen sollen und werde sie auch in Zukunft grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellenBei diesen Schuhen geht es nach einer kurzen Gehzeitca1 Stunde aber super in 37Vielleicht sollte man sie gleich eine GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer nehmenIch finde diese Marke groÃ\\x9fartigDas Leder ist super schÃ¶n und weich Die Schuhe sind toll verarbeitet und ein Hingucker This is the perfect shoe for walking and moderate hikinglight enough to wear everyday and rugged enough for rocky and wet trails  Just toss them in the wash when needed  This summer I landscaped my hilly and in places very muddy backyard in these shoes  They held up and still look great LOVE the look and color of these shoes and in general love Minnetonka products I ordered my normal size 8 12 and couldnt even get my heel in the shoe So I ordered a size 9 Though I could get my foot in the shoes they were so narrow they hurt This is the first product Ive bought from Minnetonka that was so narrow All their other shoes have run true to the width indicated If you have narrower feet these are for you My office mate loved them and now theyre hersIm sorry they didnt fit me as they are really good looking shoes They are soooo comfy and great in the water I love a shoe that you can hike and go in and out of creeks and waterfalls with out constantly changing sheâ\\x80\\x99s This shoe is awfully heavy and seems to have no room inside  I had to really  struggle to get my foot inside a shoe a half size larger than what I generally wear  It was quite uncomfortable  Since I purchased it at a much reduced price and it seems to be well constructed I am sending the pair on to the thrift store  It is my hope that the shoes may actually fit someone who really needs a new pair  This is the first time I have been dissatisfied with Minnetonka shoes I ordered a pair Says men on listing so ordered smaller to fit woman size  Shipped a womens shoe at that size Too small  I reordered 3 pairs with Women sizes because I was going on a trip and needed them  Checked cart Said Merrell womens J033884 HYDROTREKKER SYN SHANDAL Brindle 9 US plus 2 other sizescolor  Great Correct sizes I thought  Order arrived  with Womens  55 6 65  NOT AT ALL WHAT I ORDEREDNow I have 4 pair to return None of which is what I ordered First time I have ever had a shoe in my size that has run too small Great looking shoe though I love these so much I sent a pair to my daughterThey are comfortable and cuteLOVE THEM The shoe is comfortable a d easy to get into Love the color too These shoes fit length wise just fine But the toe area was too constricting I have pretty narrow feet myself but these just felt like there was not enough height as well as width in the toe Nice sneaker Fits great and comfortable Great color style and comfort I would definitely purchase these again Most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn I wore them for less than two hours The heal dug into two spots on my heals and caused huge blisters The toe area also rubbed the skin off several toes It was a week before I could wear closed shoes again Super schÃ¶ner Schuh Leider fehlten uns ein paar Dornen I like this running shoe  I ran a virtual 10K road race and ran a pretty good time in them  However the metal spikes needed to be replaced after one 10K road race  You should only run in this shoe on a Track rubber or synthetic  I wish the manufacturer would have specified that in that I nearly destroyed the shoe running on concrete and streets  There is plastic grip teeth that were ruined  Also if you are a distance runner buy lots of metal spikes the spikes will wear after run like a 10K  Oh yeah running in the rain no problem the shoe itself does not absorb water like trainers but your feet will get wet  For the price I paid under 4000 not a bad purchase  I am going to buy another pair My daughter loves these shoes She is a sprinter in track and said these really helped step up her game Her only complaint is she wishes the laces were longer She struggles to tie them she canâ\\x80\\x99t double knot it So during her 200 run they came untied and she placed 4th because of it This is an awesome shoe but the sizes run small  I may have converted the sizes incorrectly  But since they are sold in mens sizes I purchased a 65M to get a 85W  Although we were a little disappointed we were able to return the shoe at no cost for the correct size These are great track sneakers My daughter has requested the same pair for the second year Spikes are easy to put in and take out Very lightweight I wish that this shoe came with extra spikes Had to go buy spikes immediately I had bought these for my daughter  tried to diff sizes but she said they were uncomfortable Shes flat footed  needs wide shoes so I believe that might be what the problem was Too narrow for her feet As with most spikes they tend to run small These fit better for our runner than the Saucony style Bought a pair for my 12yr old daughter She loves them She has set two personal bests wearing them Good spikes Exact product great price quite ship Highly recommended I liked these shoes at first I liked the simple look and the comfort But the first time I wore them in actually rain my feet got wet Really bummed because Iâ\\x80\\x99ve missed the return window now sehr gutes Material ideal zum wandern und outdoor These are great shoes My review reflects the fit as tighter than others of the same size but different brand I would recommend going at least 12 size up Runs small wide is very narrow I have very large feet I bought the largest size and they actually fit very well I love walking in Skechers Because I have neuropathy in my feet and they help me keep going all day long La verdad no esperaba que quedaran tambien el acoginamiento en el tendÃ³n de la parte trasera del pie lo hace un zapato muy comodo Lo recomiendo para gente que gusta de zapatos que no le molesten en ninguna parte del pie y que les encante la comodidad El mateiral como de gamusa a lo mejor dificulta un poco su limpieza pero en relaciÃ³n con al comodidad que representan es un detalle insignificante Excellent comfortable Bonne qualitÃ© Great shoes The shoes are very comfortable These are seriously one of the most comfortable shoes Ive ever owned  First pair of Skechers and Im in love  I have wide feet and my left foot is half a size bigger than my right so I usually cant just buy shoes without trying them first  I intended these to be personal shoes to use when I go out of the house with the family but dont want to wear running shoes  But Ive found myself bringing them to work because they look very professional and at the same time feel very comfortable  I get about 12000 steps a day when Im at work so these have been amazing feet savers  I even used them to teach a dance class and forgot that I wasnt wearing my dance shoes because they didnt stick to the wooden floors like basketball shoes yet have much more comfort than formal dance shoes  Im definitely getting another pair Im glad I took another reviewers advice and ordered a half size larger than what I normally wear  My sneaker size is 95 but I ordered a 10 in this shoe and it fits just right  The memory foam is perfect as I work in a retail environment and am on my feet many hours a day  The casual loafer style also fits my work environment I am very happy I made the decision to purchase this pair of shoes and will probably buy more in different colors The price here cant be beat I purchased another set of memory foam loafers at a local payless chain and for 10 more than what I paid for these Sketchers they are not even close in comfort Highly recommend these These are exceptionally comfortable loafers They are very light and they have the very comfortable memory foam insole I have a relatively high instep so loafers do not always work well for me These are surprisingly comfortable Oddly enough they are more comfortable to walk around in than they are to wear while sitting high instep thing  I guess The material seems to breath better my feet to not get as hot as they would with other shoes The quality of the materials and of the construction is top notch I may even buy another pair in a different color Super comfortable Easy on and off I can walk miles at a time and feet fell fine I bought these for a exact replacement of my very worn pair should they ever wear out I later bought another pair because my old ones were very worn This last pair is exactly the same and beyond great for walking and comfort Easy to put on and off is a great feature also Iâ\\x80\\x99m searching for a cute yet quality shoe for a trip to Barcelona in fall  This shoe was almost perfect  Its really very pretty I got the wine color  Itâ\\x80\\x99s very comfortable and the material has a lot of stretch and giveâ\\x80\\x94 comfortable out of the box  The only uncomfortable part was that my big toe rubbed on the top of the shoe  Not the endâ\\x80\\x94 they were the right sizeâ\\x80\\x94 but the top which bothered me while I walked  If youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking about these definitely give them a try though I really want to love these but the support isnt there I wish there was a Chaco support lightweight type of running shows It still feels light Its like putting you foot in paper Thats how light it is I have flat feet so it does hurt to walk in these Still very cute Ive loved chacos sandals for several years I was thrilled to find out they carried regular shoes when my work pair were coming to the end of their life I work on my feet and my fitbit reports between 7000 and 10000 steps a day These have been great They have the arch support Ive come to expect with chacos and are as lightweight as my off duty slide on sketchers As long as they turn out to be as durable as my sandals these will be a phenomenal purchase The only thing I dislike is that the padding on the upper part of the back of the shoe is not enough  They cause blisters on my heel at the top  I hope that stops as they break in because the rest of the shoe is great I have very high arches and am constantly battling planter fasciitis  Chacos tend to work well for my feet so i thought I would try these for running and walking  I added my own insoles on top of the ones that came with the shoes and have been running for 4 weeks with no problems I bought these when I needed something to wear for hiking AND city walking that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t ugly AF like most hiking shoes Here I am two years later my Chacos have strolled through nature trails and city streets in 30 states and 3 continents The tread has finally worn down so Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting a second pair Theyâ\\x80\\x99re great Thank goodness for hiking shoes that come in civilized black rather than fugly swirly browns I love these shoes I have walked lite hiking and worked in them They run just a little small I ordered my normal size I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes have been great for that I was hesitant to buy tennis shoes from Chacos I adore their sandals and the high arch support but wondered if the same could be accomplished in their tennis shoes I was wrong these are awesome I get on the treadmill first thing in the morning and those of us with PF know thats when the worst pain is These make it so much better Highly recommend Was looking for a shoe for workon feet and a lot of walkingthat have a footbed like a pair of cheap flip flops bought last year that are similar to chacos The flip flops are all I wear when not working dont hurt my feet So farso good just wish they came with a choice of width and my feet are different from each other Like other reviewson one heel it rubbed and the opposite foot it rubbed pinky toe with socks on irritating Just have to breakin I go through work shoesinserts about 6 months  On a side note didnt appreciate the UPS man just throwing the package on porch Just because no car doesnt mean no one home and watching I absolutely love these shoesIâ\\x80\\x99ve ordered 2 pairs so far Some of my favorite things about this shoe is that thereâ\\x80\\x99s little to no need to â\\x80\\x9cbreak inâ\\x80\\x9d the shoe they fit my wide feet very comfortably they are very sturdy and they are very comfortable and I can walk for miles and not get blisters I mainly wear them for work I work in a kitchen as a waitress and these do an amazing job They grip well on slick surfaces I just wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t run on the slick surfaces My last pair lasted me just shy of a year but I did wear them pretty much everyday walking anywhere from 46 miles a day give or take They are also great for most  hiking endeavorsI highly recommend these shoes if youâ\\x80\\x99re looking for a light hiking shoe or a gripping work shoe Another well made product from Clarks Ive been wearing the Clarks brand for over 25 years now and with just a couple exceptions I have not been disappointed When I order a size 12 I know it will fit right out of the box with mostly no break in period These shoes are comfortable for every day wear and work Very happy with the purchase Short break in time and great Im on my feet all day Did not feel fatigued at the end of the day They were very comfortable This is a great product I would purchase Narrow shoe nowhere near US sizesnot real clarks Wear to work Shoe is very comfortable Came quick and packaged well Mi sono arrivate un paio di scarpe numero 27da

comfortable running shoes ive ever wear Amazing shoes Soft light and cozy Nothing to say more Thank you Seller Good for running Adidas os best It was a bit of a wait but completely worth it Amazing shoe I love them Improperly described I purchased these sneakers for my son and they were listed as mens When I received the shoes they said womens on the box and looked like womens sneakers Very disappointed Great shoes I have a high arch and slightly wide foot plus I suponate when I run These fit perfectly and have the right support to keep my feet from rolling out Plus half the price of my normal running shoes They also did well for lifting Le scarpe sono belle ma il rinforzo in plastica che dovrebbe tenere il piede piÃ¹ fermo dopo 1 mese di utilizzo si Ã¨ rotto in entrambe le scarpe Viene usata da un ragazzo di 15 anni di peso 55 kg per pallamano una scarpa di questo tipo non puÃ² rompersi dopo 2 mese di allenamenti SCHUHE fÃ¼r Gr43 ein bisschen zu gross Guter Halt fÃ¼r die KnÃ¶chel  Qualitativ hochwertiger Schuh Zapatillas buenÃ\\xadsimas para jugar a balonmano RelaciÃ³n calidad  precio excelente y el envÃ\\xado rapidisimo The shoes had very little support This contributed to injury Pris un 38 pour un 38 elles conviennent parfaitement et en plus elles sont jolies et classe au top I bought these for my son because I was having a hard time finding a mens version in his size The first time he wore them he set a PR in his 800 He has continued to improve and set PRs as a freshman runner in track The shoes are comfortable enough for him to run his 800 and the 3200 They are very lightweight and yet durable because of the way the shoe is made and the material My daughter uses this for track season and she was very pleased The shoes are bright which made it easy to spot her clear across the track I just looked for her shoes when she was with her teammates in uniform and she was easy to spot The shoes were very light not heavy at all which made them perfect for her to run in For normal shoes I am a size 75 I always wear size 8 for Saucony trainers and 85 for Saucony spikes and XC spikes but for these they are really thin so I got 8 and that was perfect good quality for cost Ojo en algÃºn lado dice que son de piel NO lo son o para ser mÃ¡s exactos son de piel Vegana Para el precio que tienen me estoy pensando en devolverlo Daughter loves them My 12 year old daughter really likes this shoe She said it is comfortable and fits very well Someone else really likes it too since they stole her first pair lol Not wide enough for my own feet  Nicely made product though good quality I only received one side of this shoesneed the other sideneed the left Beautiful shoes Very thin and an exact fit to my size 7 foot Since they are thin there is not much between them and the ground There is very little arch support so would not recommend wearing more than few hours especially if you have a chronic plantar La mejor compra Hermosos llegaron

pick I ordered a 12 size up as recommended I probably could of gone a full size up But my daughter has a narrow foot and I was afraid her foot would â\\x80\\x9cflop outâ\\x80\\x9d So we will pay the extra and go up a size as needed If your child as a more average size foot I would say you could size up at least 12full size if they are on the cusp of that growth spurt If your child has a wide foot I do not recommend these shoes Againthis is MY OPINION I feel has been very fair and honest In the picture it shows laces What I received was Velcro  Twice Not happy Not as described what made these look so undesirable was the fact that they came with a giant velcro strap across the top THIS STRAP WAS NOT IN THE PHOTO So I feel I was fooled They look like old men  shoe SAD My son was excited for these shoes Unlike others I WAS looking for velcro because although he knows how to tie his shoes he would rather slip them on and off and I would rather still have a decent rather then broken heel of his shoe Turns out the heel was not the problem Instead the toe part it is clothwoven on top of a more solid base of the shoe began to unravel a couple months into wear and now it looks completely frayed over an inch or so and tacky revealing the plastic form of the shoe underneath Otherwise the shoe has held up great the white part in the front is fine the tread on the bottom it fits he loves it etc but he will be getting a new pair of a DIFFERENT shoe because I am not taking my chances on this pair again These shoes are wonderful Adidas quality but as others have stated the item description is incorrect  I ordered the royal blue color with laces and received a velcro closure Its otherwise a fantastic shoe and the velcro closes all the way across and stays shut I think my son almost 10 is just about too old to velcro he disagrees so were keeping them  But Ill choose a different style next time After being loyal to UA and Nike shoes for kids Ive recently dabbled in purchasing some Adidas shoes and am pleasantly surprised by their comfort and quality  They tend to run slightly bigger and more true to size than Nike which run small and are better quality than UA which tend to wear quickly and have color wear off  The Adidas are really the best if both Nike and UA with sizing and quality  These are lightweight attractive and fit well  These are nice kids shoes and worthy of five stars This shoe doesnt actually have the velcro strap as it appears to have in the product imageIf your child is like mine and not the best at tying their shoes yet then you know that the velcro strap really comes in handy which is the main reason why I selected this shoe to purchase so needless to say I was pretty disappointed that the product image was inaccurateOther than that though its a good shoe and we decided to go ahead and keep it and continue perfecting our shoetying skills They fit great But we had these shoes for a month before they started falling apart My son is 5 I bought these because two kids in my sons daycare ages 1 and 3 have these shoes and theyre adorable However after a month they started falling apart The toe part now looks like a dog started eating them Its so sad especially for the price Walmart shoes may have been a better bet for quality I am a 73 year old Breast Cancer Survivor almost 9 years only 4 11 tall and wear children size shoes 312 XW  Was thrilled when I found a pink shoe in the Big Kids Size that fit me perfectly  It has extra depth so I can insert my Alegria insole protecting my feet that no longer have muscle due to chemo side affect  Thank you for having this amazing shoe just right and comfortable for me when I walk or go to my Cancer Survivor Exercise Class Ive been buying new balance shoes for several years for my kids  The new v4 of the 990s is just not good  The quality has gone down the fit is different and the shoes are completely falling apart in less than 2 months  Stitching is coming out hole in mesh on top of shoe etc  Whats really shameful is that the cost of these v4s went up so much compared to the v3s  When the quality comes back Ill reconsider I think that the shoes are really nice but I ordered the light grey 990 V4 in the size that my son normally wears and the shoes were like a half of a size 2 small length I went back to order the next size up and they were sold out I ended up ordering the NB 888 in dark grey Magnet and they are even nicer with better support than the newer version 990 DISGUSTING I cannot even believe someone would pack these nasty shoes and pass them off as a new Returning These are the ONLY tennis shoes my 5 year old can wear  He has a wide foot with a large instep and he has trouble getting his feet in shoes  These shoes are great because they come in a WIDE and EXTRA WIDE  We bought the extra wide and they fit him perfectly and were super comfortable The shoes were really nice I loved the color and how they looked on my sons foot They fit exactly and the goal was to get them in a bigger size but the size was unavailable I will purchase them again in a larger size for later as he grows They were tremendous with issuing my refund I did not like having to pay for shipping as part of my refund but the shoes were incredibly inexpensive so no complaints here Very nice quality and look My child is very particular about her shoes and needs a wide space for her toes These extra wide shoes are perfect Couldnt find any other shoe out there to meet her needs Fast shipping The shoe colors are off The soles are thinner than the original 990 Not as much support Emailed the support team about my concern but they never responded back Returning the product My foot doctor explained that the shoes are built so that they tilt inward in the heel area as most people walk this way  Huh  Thats just plain nuts  Secondly the gray pair I bought a few months agosame shoethe back of the heel areanot the bottom of the shoehas compressed after 3 weeks of wear  After spending 80 on this New Balance 990 shoe its unwearable  What a waste of my money  Well see how these new ones wear  Im not holding my breath Seems to be a comfortable supportive shoe As an adult female who still has to wear kids shoes I have a very hard time finding anything appropriate to wear I hope New Balance continues to make at least one or two styles that are not pink

love it Wouldnt mind buying other colors Sehr schÃ¶ner und bequemer Sneaker von ARA  Weiches Wildleder fÃ¤llt grÃ¶Ã\\x9fengerecht aus stoÃ\\x9fdÃ¤mpfende Sohle und WechelfuÃ\\x9fbett  klare Kaufempfehlung This is a great shoe for dressing up or casual wear Love the style color and fit I wear an 8 had to send it back for a 7 12 which was absolutely no problem for return I do have a narrow foot so that is the reason for the smaller shoe Very comfortable and good support I love love love these shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a similar pair for five years and am so happy I found more of the same companystyle on here the absolute best and comfiest womenâ\\x80\\x99s shoes I am always on the lookout for sporty shoes that I can slip on and dont have to wear socks with Its not an easy find With that said these shoes are sporty and quite cute They look almost knit and the gray color is a nice neutral I was really pleased with how the shoe lookedIn addition to a cute shoe I require a decent amount of arch support I love Vionic shoes I purchased these because of all of the reviews noting these had great arch support I have one questionWhere is said arch support If you are expecting a decent amount of arch support like a Vionic shoe  this is NOT it The insole has a bit of bump  else its pretty flat without a lot of padding I was super disappointed in how flimsy the insole was The good thing is the insole is removable so if you love the shoe and need more support  you can easily add your own insole I purchased this pair of Ryka ballet flats to replace a pair I bought a couple of years ago that I had worn out  They are so incredibly comfortable and are the perfect flat to wear when you need to be a little more shoe than a pair of sneakers but not dragging out a pair of heels I really like the Ryka black flat with a black sole  No more clown feet with those big white rubber bumpers  Shoe is comfortable in every way I appreciatefit style lightweight and flexible breathable fabric and looks attractive with all of my pants and capris  True to size in a size 10W even a little room to wiggle my toes I have several pairs of Ryka all size 65  I love the brand These were huge in the heel area and a bit wide across the bridge of my foot Before you ask I double checked to make sure they had not sent me the 65 Wide It is stamped 65 M  I am so disappointed because they are just what I needed I do not think the size 6 would be any better due to the width Absolute Comfort is what first comes to mind with these  With these available in a Wide width it made for a perfect fit at 6 12 W  These will be my go to slip ons for around the house no break in needed  I love them it is like they were made for my foot I ordered this in black and came back for two more colors  I wear a size 9 and it was a full size 9 with a little room  It is not narrow or tight which I like  I have been looking for comfy flats for awhile and Ryka got it right I ordered these in a 75 wide and they fit my wide foot comfortably I do not notice any arch supports I like these shoes It is hard to find cute shoes for a wide foot They are comfortable for a short term wear however I have not tried wearing them for super long periods of time so I cannot attest to how they feel after wearing for a whole day These shoes are comfortable out of the box Ive been wearing them almost everyday since receiving them When they get dirty I toss them in the washer on delicate cycle and then air dry I bought these for my son and I was hoping they would be a good choice for the winter weather  He likes them but one issue is that theyre not comfortable for all day wearing Returned them Too stiff and narrow for an athletic tween Awesome boots Cool Great Very  comfortable my grandson  loves  them Keeps  feet very  warm Great Stuff Nice boots My son hasnt complained that they hurt so far so good  Fits well EstÃ¡n de moda con traje o ropa de vestir fue un regalo segÃºn para el 14 de Feb pero no aguante y se los dÃ\\xada antes estÃ¡n padrisimos tipo piel con ante  el  los querÃ\\xada y andaba buscando por todos lados le encantaron los super recomiendo  talla exacta tipo para pie gordito super cÃ³modos si tienes el pie delgado pide medio nÃºmero menos No me gusto que en el anuncio dice que se n de cuero y ya la realidad dice que es piel sintÃ©tica para mÃ\\xad es un engaÃ±o estÃ¡n bonitos pero aÃºn asÃ\\xad queda un poco la duda de la autenticidad por eso le doy solo una estrella Es lo que esperaba el color me gustÃ³ mucho el diseÃ±o en cuanto a la combinaciÃ³n del material con el cual estÃ¡n elaborados me encantÃ³ y son realmente cÃ³modos Calza perfecto  muy cÃ³modos  se ven muy buen con pantalon casual  muy buena relaciÃ³n calidad  precio Me encantaron la talla me quedo perfecto y son iguales a como lo mencionan en la descripciÃ³n muy recomendable Buen acabado y ajuste perfecto la gamuza le da un toque elegante si me agradaron mucho Estan muy padres comodos Satisfecho con esta compra me gustÃ³ mucho este modelo bonito diseÃ±o y son cÃ³modos Son algo estrechos pedÃ\\xad mi talla exacta pero aÃºn asÃ\\xad me quedo algo chico pero igual ya los cambiÃ© mejor por una mÃ¡s grande Muy buen producto tardaron como 5 dÃ\\xadas en adaptarse a mi pie por lo que fue un poco incÃ³modo al principio despuÃ©s me quedaron muy bien These sneakers are comfortable not as light as running shoes but good enough for being casual sneakers The size is a bit bigger than expected I got a Womens 75 US size and its equal to a 39 23 EU size usually a 75 its a 38 or 385 on other brands i liked the retro design and the chunky look also was a great price for this brand so i assumed it would fit widebut it only looks wide but feels narrow on the toe part hurt the feet I like these shoes but they are way way way too big I am a size 75 and I ordered my size and they fit more like a 95 Massive shoes and not true to size I gave them away Increibles I like the shoe just like the picture A little rough inside These shoes are a little heavy but that is likely because I tend to go for lightweight sneakers The shoes are really cute and Love the style My issue is comfort I wore these for a day and they are not small but something about how they fit causes some discomfort around my toes and ankle Not unbearable and there is enough room to wear thicker socks that should offer some more comfort Where them when I going to the park if you have over arching feet this isnâ\\x80\\x99t the shoe for you the sole on the ball isnâ\\x80\\x99t that thick so after awhile my feet start to hurt but if youâ\\x80\\x99re just wearing for a couple hours theyâ\\x80\\x99re great A little narrow But overall cool retro look Excelentes estÃ¡n fenomenales al venir de Amazon USA ya van 2 veces que no me llega con caja original  la cambian por maltrato de transporte en cuanto al tenis estÃ¡n de lujo CÃ³modas y bonitas Der Schuh ist sehr bequem und leicht zu tragen Alles so wie erwartet The sizing of these is way off I listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal I wear a lot of NB shoes of this same style and they were right I needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow I returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also so I guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit I give up  I wouldnt recommend ordering these online unless you know for a fact what size is appropriate Try these on first if at all possible I purchased these shoes a little under 2 weeks ago and am not impressed with the durability of the stitching on them I skate maybe an hour every other day but I do not do any crazy tricks an Ollie and kickflip if Iâ\\x80\\x99m feeling it and this is just from a small time frame of wearing them My previous vans half cabs lasted 9 months I had heard good things about New Balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all They are also not comfortable in the slightest even after wearing them in a good bit Maybe I got a bad batch but if not do better New Balance I ordered the 115 Wide since New Balance has been exceptionally consistent in sizing for me To my surprise these did not fit when I tried them on The reason is theyre not the standard 4E wide for New Balance but only 2E wide I tried two of these before realizing the problem They look great but if youre buying it for the width be sure to know theyre not standard wides I like these shoes  Theyre comfortable and look cool  But like the other reviewers statedorder one to 15 sizes larger than you normally do I didnâ\\x80\\x99t even know that New Balance made skate style shoes These shoes look nice and feel great The only thing I am not a fan of is the big â\\x80\\x9cNâ\\x80\\x9d sticked on the side Branding is branding oh well The shoes breathe and help keep the feet from getting a serious case of the stankfoot I should have paid closer attention to the reviews  I have purchased several New Balance shoes and these 95W are tighter than past pairs  I have been thinking that the material will break in over time however the tightness is around the panels that secure the sideslaces  That firm material doesnt seem to have much give and it immediately aches  Other than the shoe is well constructed  Im disappointed I will have to return the shoes for a 10W I bought my original fit that I buy for all shoes and these were nowhere near the size  I couldnt even get the shoes on over my toes  I got refund so no harm no foul Commfy Die Schuhe sehen niedlich aus Da sie so aufdringlich riechen habe ich sie 2x gewaschen Sie stinken immer noch elendig so dass ich sie meinem Kind nicht anziehen mÃ¶chte da ich denke dass sie nicht gesundheitlich unbedenklich sein kÃ¶nnen Wie bei jedem Kappa Schuh ist die Passform perfekt Durch den schmalen Schnitt wirken sogar meine FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe in GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 43 klein Super weicher Material Mein Sohn benutzt zum FuÃ\\x9fball ARTICOLO ARRIVATO SENZA SCATOLA ORIGINALE E SENZA FATTURA O SCONTRINI DUBITO CHE LE SCARPE SIANO ORIGINALIð\\x9f¤¨ TrÃ¨s bien et adaptÃ© Ã\\xa0 son utilisation Super bon achatBonne grandeurParfait Bought these for my son for Xmas   He absolutely loves them Very bright and super comfy Fit comfort price  all good Very good quality for the price light and comfortable I have two wild boys whom are 7 and 10  They love gym and are always involved in at least one sport per season  They are very hard on shoes because they live to run and jump  We bought several pairs of the Reebok ATV after my oldest son saw the great commercial for them and decided he had to have a pair  My boys wore the crap out of them and loved every minute of it  Please bring those shoes back  We have been hooked on Reebok for their comfort and durability ever sinceI bought each of my boys a pair of the Yourflex Train 10s for Christmas to wear to school and for Gym class  The different colored tread on the bottom of the shoes have begun to come undone after two days each  It was obviously added last in the factory in order to enhance the appearance but is a complete fail as it has lowered the functionality of the shoe tremendouslyIve seen this happen with other shoe companies that attempt the same visual tactic  In the future I will not buy any shoe that screws around with the sole like this  Im disappointed Reebok  Ive grown to expect more from your company  I will continue to buy your brand but will pay more attention to what im buying I had to send the first pair back A piece of the sole ripped off after only a few wears and my son only wore them to school I did reorder them bc my son loved the look and said they were comfortable So just hoping it was a fluke  Nope they didnt hold up  Dont waste your money This is my second time buying a pair of Reeboks for my kindergartner They look great and fit well The only trouble is the listing is confused so I received the ALT model instead of the model that is described I cant speak to the quality since we sent these back  The picture and description led me to believe the shoes were lace up shoes  I ordered a size 1 and when they arrived they were a velcro closure which is not what we were looking for  Otherwise it was a nice looking shoe my child loves these and the black and red color comfortable sneaker great price Hard to review a shoeWearing them as Im writing this  Super comfortable Perfect for walking gym everydayWill get soaked in the rain obviouslyEasy to clean and dry Amazing shoes and fit perfectly Light weight good traction and overall great price I got them for half price These shoes are a hit or miss I bought two pairs and it seemed the two pairs were different Although the underlying shape was the same the sole on one of them was grey and the other was white Also the 105 size was somehow bigger than the size 11 to our confusion The shoes is also very similar to mens sizing as opposed to womens sizing which is also very confusing Love these A bit lightweight so can not imagine they would last long if you actually wore them running I use them for casual day to day use These are great light running shoes at a very good price Excelente producto tal y como se describe excelente calidad comodidad y tiempo de entrega Love them Fits a little bigger than I expected but they are extremely comfortable IL FAUT PRENDRE1 Ã\\x80 2 POINTS PLUS PETITS At least half size down itâ\\x80\\x99s too big These shoes are super comfortable and really cute  Best purchase ever  They fit true to size I find this shoe to be very comfortable I bought them due to having joint foot and knees problems I do have a challenge in getting them on as fit nice and snug to prevent the foot from slipping around A zipper up the front would be nice And yes i will buy them again We got what we wanted  a sensible comfortable nononsense pair of shoes  no fashion statement but  just right for walking and not tripping running and not slipping hopping and never skipping This product actually is making my plantar faciaitis better after 6 mons of pain Like walking on baloonsvery happy The shoes look good feel good It is just that when I wear shoes all day they have to be soft because my toes will hurt The shoes are soft and because they are new I need to work them in They are so comfortable  and I love the colour  Very good product  ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Great sneaker I have problems with plantar fasciitis Great walking shoe This shoe doesnt come in half sizes I bought 2 The smaller one is too small and the larger is too large Both very uncomfortable bc of this A shame for an attractive shoe Gift to granddaughter says fit and feel great all day I bought this for my daughter and she loves it so muchVery comfortable feel good on your feet and the color pink is very attractive These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn  Snug around the heel and lots of room  So far I dont have any foot pain  Would definitely recommend The sizing chart is wierd because its Unisex Sizing My foot is 9x3 and according to the listings size chart I should order a Mens 5Womans 6 However Im a US Womans Size 775 and can wear a Mens 556Since this seller offers free returns I went ahead and ordered the recommended Size 6 in case the sizes were Mens and a Size 7 in case the sizes were Womans so I could compare fitThe Size 6 was too snug and short The Size 7 fits well lengthwise but is a tad wide I kept the 7 because I wear socks and wanted to use an insole for plantars fasciitis The shoes do not come in a box they come in a nice little bag  which makes them perfect for Returing the Size 6 was as easy as taking the unpacked shoe bag to Kohls although since I have a printer I chose to drop it off at UPS in the original reusable Amazon bagA previous reviewer mentioned that they broke their ankle wearing these shoes I can see how that could happen because the 3DKnit weave of this particular shoe is very pliable and soft Literally the shoe upper feels like a loose fitting sock your Grandma might crochet The collar of the shoe is so flimsy a hard kick would likely send the shoe flying off your foot So it is impossible for me to imagine anyone running in this shoe or walking faster than 1015 mins per mile There simply is not enough structure to the body of the shoe for any type of performance activity These shoes are not in the same league and will not perform at anywhere near the same level as Adidas Primeknit Nike Flyknit or similar type of slipon sneakersHowever its a very comfortable light weight shoe and perfect for casual wear and short walks It is a great grab and go shoe and unlike the higher end brands names I find these to be convenient airport security shoes because they are incredibly easy oneasy off and wont make me a target for theft as I leave the airport or check into a hotelThe listing photos do not so the shoe justice They are cute fashionable and comfortable I say this as a person who owns over 100 shoes at or near the 150 price pointIf you plan on doing a lot of walking over 5 miles Id recommend getting a good orthotics insole for arch support and heel impact or wear a performance walking shoe instead That being said I recommend these Sneakers as a lowcost option for travel because they are light weight great for casual walking easy to pack and perfect for security check pointsNOTE I was NOT compensated in any way for my review I paid full price for the pair Im wearing in the photo I think some of the other reviews may be fake so I wanted to add a comprehensive and honest review Theres nothing I dislike about these shoes I havent had shoes this comfortable in years I am a size 9 and thats what I ordered and the fit is perfect Ive been wearing them daily for hours and these shoes are the best comfort of any expensive shoe Ive purchased in the past  Im elated and thanks for supplying an affordable comfortable shoe These are super fun looking shoes People ask me about them every time I wear them Most of the upper shoe is knitlike and airy and really comfortable However theres also too much slippage in the toebox and my feet roll to the inside with each step I wouldnt wear these if I needed to do much walking but for average wear theyre ok Theyre fun and colorful and I hope they last long enough for me to get over them Lol I ordered  my actual size but turns out a halfsize smaller mightve been better I dont think that wouldve improved the pronation though Just getting started with these Love it Really nice option for running and athletics Might want to add gels but I need a softer footbed Upper is a little extra pliable and less secure than the oldschool toebox but the quality is fight on par with all the top brands of similar design Truly Excellent sneaker they are very well made and extremely comfortable If you have any foot problems these are your answer They give to accommodate most foot issues They are extremely lightweight and I bought the MultiColor which is truly an eye catcher Do not pass these up  This is great shoes very comfortable and very lightweight It is really good for walking and running Its ture size and great value Its breathable and can wear them all day and never get sweating feet I recommend this shoes I bought these as a birthday gift for my hubby He loves them and wears them all the time Lightweight and comfortable One of the shoes is angled awkwardly making me walk off my gait Makes me walk with my foot leaning inward as if I have no arch I waited too long to return them so theyre going in the trash I really liked the quality of this pair of shoes great color too Awesome price The shoes feel real comfortable too I got a half size larger and it works perfectly i hate wearing shows so this is close as i get with out having to wear flip flops Zapatos cÃ³modos y

Echtleder und eine hochgezogene rutschfeste GummisohleEinfach ein gelungener KinderschuhDer Kinderschuh ist nicht schlabbrig weich sondern gibt den KinderfÃ¼Ã\\x9fen halt und das Leder drÃ¼ckt trotzdem nichtFroddo fÃ¤llt ein kleines bisschen grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer aus als gewohnte Marken The slight wedge makes it uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time I thought it was a flat sporty boot It does fit on the large size I should have gone half size down Will keep them anyway Really happy with these  they are very cute and exactly what I wanted I like to get an extra 23â\\x80\\x9d in a hidden wedge if possibleOne note  the soft furry lining that you see coming out at the top of the shoe only goes down about an inch inside The heel area and inside of the shoe is NOT lined with it it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t bother me really but the picture makes it seem like itâ\\x80\\x99s lined when itâ\\x80\\x99s not I tested the shoes in the rain today and they felt great They kept my feet warm and dry the whole time They are also comfortable I live in NYC so I walk everywhere all day long I was looking for a stylish pair of waterproof sneaker shoes and they are perfect Though they are not fully lined with faux fur they have a bit of fur trim around the ankle which feels pretty good I will definitely buy more shoes from this company I am very satisfied with the product Loved the look of this sneakerbootfunctional yet stylish and thats exactly how it looks when wearing it Really like the zippers on each side that makes it so easy to get them on and off Would recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable yet not heavy boot for cold weather They are really cute but not super comfortable I am size 7 and 65 was to big I to order size 6 it fits as expected but the sole is really uncomfortable You got Grego she like them the Color was ok yet if they were Blond tiny bit mo Fur eighter inside if not Outside they would of been loved Super cute and really comfortable Something Ive been looking for Love the look for these boots but not super comfortable and very narrow my suggestion order up a half size and in wide My daughter absolutely loves them  They fit just perfect My mom enjoys her shoes Easy to put on and fasten the straps THIS WAS A GREAT BUY I PURCHASED THESE FOR MY GRANDMOTHER WE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING SHOES BECAUSE OF THE SWELLING IN HER FEET WHICH CAUSED HER TO BE UNBALANCED WE TRIED NEW BALANCE AND OTHER BRANDS WHEN SHE TRIED THESE ON SHE SAID THEY FEEL GOOD THE WIDTH COMFORT AND THE SOFTNESS OR THE SHOE AND ABLITY TO ADJUST THE STRAP WAS GREAT NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE  I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM ESP FOR PEOPLE WITH FEET ISSUES Got a great fit and didnt have to be hassled by traffic Schuhe statt beige habe in grau erhalten Absolut vielseitiger Schuh These were great but they rubbed my ankles and my upper heal real bad I got my full return and ordered the facet 60 low They cut better around my ankle These would be great for anyone who

get him a new pair This pair is one of his Christmas presents Really like these shoes from SAS Ordered them in an extremely hard to find size  14 AA  slim   They look and fit great Highly recommend these American made shoes I dont know what it is but its not comfortable I have been buying the white leather of the same model which is very comfortable so I thought a change might be nice but no Extremely comfortable I have wide feet and flat feet These shoes fit well and re not tight and are very comfortable  Ive had them for a out 2 months and they are great Made in the USA is important too Am a repeat buyer of SAS shoes very comfortable and durable shoes worth the money This is my husbands second pair  He loves them  Very comfortable  Wear well  He had a pair he has worn every day for two years and they still look very good  I bought these as a spare pair Best shoe ever I walk miles eash up and down the halls I work in a Childrens hospital so my shoes take a beating The last pair lasted for 2 years Nike and Adidas I had to buy every 45 months Thank You San Antonio Shoes Great shoes Comfortable right out of box Excellent workmanship Happy made in USA This is the third set of these sneakers that my husband has bought  His foot pain went away instantly  His podiatrist recommended he stick with SAS too This is my third pair of SAS Journey Mesh Sneakers  The feel is very nice

und der Staub vom tragen des Vorbesitzers haftete noch an Eine UnverschÃ¤mtheit I rant and rave to all my friends about these shoes They are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought Iâ\\x80\\x99m an orthodontic technician so Iâ\\x80\\x99m constantly up and down on and off my feet for 10 hours a day depending on the day I have never had a pair of shoes that helped my feet legs and back from hurting after a long shift till I bought these Best part is I bought a second pair for my everyday shoes also â\\x80\\x9cMy New Lightweight Sneakers â\\x80\\x9c I a size 8 Medium I received these today I tried the shoes on the shoes have nice arch support lightweight comfortable nice mauve color I bought a size 8 my shoes fit true to size I will purchase another pair in the future the sneakers also make nice house slippers also have minimal stretch I received a nice compliment on my shoesð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a I got these to wear around the house instead of going barefoot on the hardwood They are very comfortable and cute For my purposes I had hoped they would slip on and off a bit easier I still have to lean down to get the heel straightened out I havenâ\\x80\\x99t worn them out but I think they would be fine I almost forgot I was wearing shoes because my feet get so much air when I wear these Its been over 90Â° where I live and I wore these without any sockswhen I took my shoes off my feet were COMPLETELY dry  not sweaty at all They are so comfortable and flexible Also standing for long periods have been easier I just ordered 4 more pairl one for my mom my daughter  two more for yours truly Very happy These seemed to be made fairly decent may even wear well but while the fit was OK in length and the width seemed good they were too tight on my feetAfter wearing them for a few minutes it became uncomfortabe and I had to remove themGlad I only wore them indoors on carpet so I was able to return them Very tight Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a shoe stretcher in for days and my feet still start to hurt within the first hour of wearing these A shame because they are very lightweight and something Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to wear daily Iâ\\x80\\x99ll keep trying to stretch them out Los tenis son super cÃ³modos y de un peso ligero Lo Ãºnico en lo cual no estoy muy satisfecha es en las condiciones en las que llegaron Ambos tenÃ\\xadan una mancha el derecho en la parte superior de al

 What do I need to order to get a 38 I have a hard time finding cute shoes in a size 13 Happy to find theseâ\\x80\\x94cute and comfortable While I hate sneakers I knew I would need something comfortable for our upcoming vacation lots of walking every day Ordered these recently and I am in love I usually go barefoot at home but these are so nice in my feet I keep them on even at home I thought Id have to break them in but honestly they feel like they were made for my feet and I find myself styling my outfits so I can wear them Super super comfortable and cute Excelentes tenis y la calidad y precio sÃºper convenientes CÃ³modos suaves bonito color A mi hijo le encantaron y se los puso de inmediato Los recomiendo Bungee laces which are awesome Fits as expected Excelente  calidad durabilidad y muy bien en relaciÃ³n precio producto Llegaron bien y antes de la fecha Our 11 year old has big feet LOL  Had trouble finding shoes wide enough  I know that New Balance is a good brand and have worn them myself before  They are not expensive Adidas and Nike  which all our shoe store seems to want to carry  both Adidas and Nike were not wide enough  he was wearing a pair of Nikes and having a lot of issues with his feet hurting when we would go for our morning walk  These dont hurt his feet and they are good solid comfortable shoes  Its important to have good shoes that fit for your childand they you want to be as cost effective as possible because they need a new pair every 6 months  You dont want to buy a brand thats going to fall apart or not provide any support from a cheap big box store  So try these  Especially if your child has a wide foot  I dont care for the red  but he likes red These arrived as described They were cute and easy for my fouryearold to slip on and off by himself He has wide feet but these fit true to size and he says they are comfortable I am really disappointed with the quality Hes been wearing them for three weeks and they are already starting to fall apart The entire family usually wears New Balance because of quality and comfort Ive never had a pair feel this cheap Im honestly wondering if they are knockoffs I love these for myself A great deal for women buying childrenâ\\x80\\x99s sizes A 55 is a womanâ\\x80\\x99s size 7 I also like that I can just pull on the faux laces are awesome However if you are wide width as I am consider a regular New Balance seems to run wide to begin with and this is the 3rd pair I have wished I had gotten regular width in These shoes are very vibrantly My son said they were comfortable He usually wears a size 6 but after reading reviews I went with a 7 and they fit him good The price was reasonably priced an overall a good buy I will be purchasing more colors These shoes look nice but they are regular tie laces not bungee laces  See photo I also sized up based on other reviews and they are way too big  These definitely run true to size I bought these sneakers for my 4th grader to wear to camp He was so happy not to be bothered with tying and untying his shoes all the time They are so comfortable too Im planning on buying a pair for myself  These sneakers give the support needed with laces but the ease of a slip on shoe My son did say that if moves a certain way then sometimes his foot will fall out of the shoe but this is true if the laces are loose as well horrible uncomfortable Bought these for my 85 year young mother in law  She loves them   Stylish comfortable well made  secure footing and reasonable priced  She loves them Love these Go with just about everything Super comfortable love fit love look Too heavy and wintery La taille est petite pour ma fille mais je vais commander maintenant la taille exacte HabÃ\\xada pedido un 10 uk y me lo trajeron

demi pointure en dessous de celle de dhabitude This product isnt true fit like the description says Theyre way too big and large for the regular Clarks Size Chart I used to buy My husband brought a 105 W pair wich is his regular size in this particular shoe brand and they were way too big like 15 bigger size Then I decided to order the shoes again in a Smaller size 10 W cause he actually like this model so much and as you can see in the picture they were exactly the same size even that we I ordered it half size smaller Im really disappointed cause my husband has tons of Clarks Shoes and this is the first time this happen maybe because I didnt buy the in the store If you are gonna buy them choose them 15 smaller size I liked these even though they are more blue than I expected  But I had to return them because they are sized pretty small  The length was close to the proper size but the width was definitely narrow Unfortunately they do not come in a wide version of my size Very comfortable and goodlooking shoes but the sizing are way off Size 105 is more like size 11512 They look huge in comparison to my other similar type of shoes and are at least 14 inch longer I had to return two pairs to get the right fit from size 105 to size 9 Muy bonitos y cÃ³modos Super comfortable for my flat feet and true to size I wear these to work a few times of week they feel like tennis shoes I will be buying at least another pair in another color Nice shoes Based off the reviews I ordered an 11 when normally my husband is a size 1213 Perfect fit Excelente calzado Fits well and looks great The gray and white go well together Most people never mention my shoes but these got a compliment Love these shoes  Clarkes fit me well and I was looking for casual above sneakers  Very nice shoes  comfortable  thx Spend 30 more dollars and get the original ones I love the look of this shoes and wanted them to fit so muchThere is no room for the toesâ\\x80¦ I ordered a size bigger and my toes were still showing lol I donâ\\x80\\x99t have fat toes Mejor de lo esperado y justo a tiempo la Entrega perfecto embalaje Muy hermosos mejor que en foto color bello talla es justa Super nice quality shoes The fabric is like a nylon Love em Esta perfecto y cÃ³modo Ive been hoping to get these sneakers for a while now and when Sperry ran out I turned to Amazon The first thing I noticed pulling the shoes out of the box was a faint yellow stain on the right shoe and some yellowing in the laces It really isnt a big deal since it kind of goes with the vintage vibeish but when I tried the shoes on they were SUPER wide in the front and only in the front In all fairness I have really narrow feet but my other pair of Sperrys fit me perfectly fine so Im not sure if they changed something up Anyhow the look of the shoes is fantastic so thats a plus Very cute comfortable and fits as expected The sole is not too high either for people that are used to flat shoes Perfect Talla adecuada buena calidad son cÃ³modas Las chanclas son perfectas muy cÃ³modas Guter Sitz sehr leichtGrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe wie gewÃ¼nschtEmpfehlenswert Best shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve worn for volleyball the only concern is lack of cushion near the balls of the feet but besides that traction lockdown comfort and design were perfect If you play for 3 hrs thatâ\\x80\\x99s when u begin to feel some soreness in your feet For volleyball players this shoe Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend to setters and liberosds just because of response and reaction time was just much better with those I didnâ\\x80\\x99t worry about lag when it came to passing and stepping into a setting position for hitting its mediocre thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lack of ankle support and if ur a hitter that jumps often Iâ\\x80\\x99d say just watch out with the landing because thatâ\\x80\\x99s what prevented a full 5 stars She absolutely loves these shoes Fit great Good but bigger and wider Love these Been searching for ages for this colour and style Perfect I love these shoes  I am a nurse and am on my feet for 14 hours  These get me through the day without any problems  Love adidas and their torsion control line of shoes They feel amazing on my feet I work 12 hours on concrete floors and my feet donâ\\x80\\x99t hurt Der Sneaker sind wirklich toll aus und wirkte bequem  Ich hÃ¤tte ihn gerne behalten und war etwas Hinund hergerissen aber er roch so schlimm nach Chemie Man bekam umgehend Kopfschmerzen Ich habe mich dann entschlossen soetwas nicht an den FÃ¼Ã\\x9fen tragen zu wollen Schade eigentlich WunderschÃ¶ner Schuh Bequem und alles topLeider stÃ¶rt mich der weiÃ\\x9fe Stoff auf den Zehen da dieser sehr sehr empfindlich ist SchÃ¶nes und groÃ\\x9fartiges Design Ich behalte den Artikellg Doris Super Passform perfekt und sie sind superleicht und bequem Ich finde die Farbe wunderbar fÃ¼r den Sommer intensiv aber nicht zu grell Ich wurde zwei mal von fremden freundlichen jungen Frauen angesprochen woher ich die Schuhe habe das ist mir mit anderen Schuhen noch nicht passiert  Dieser Schuh hat auf ganzer Linie enttÃ¤uscht Leider muss man einen Stern geben Vorne zu eng hinten zu weit Eine Passform die ich noch bei keinem Schuh erlebt hab Dazu kommt dass das Material billig wirktich habe einige Schuhe von adidas so dass ich gute VergleichsmÃ¶glichkeiten habe Die RÃ¼cksendung erfolgte problemlos allerdings erst nach einem Telefonat mit dem sehr freundlichen und hilfsbereiten Anbieter hin kostenfrei Einer meiner Lieblingsschuhe Sehr leicht und mega bequem Was mir nicht ganz gefiel war hinten der weiÃ\\x9fe Abschnitt mit der pinken adidas Aufschrift Aber nun gut da sehe ich gerne drÃ¼ber hinweg Ich finde er sieht real besser aus als auf den Fotos Der Versand ging Ã¼brigens blitzschnell Das Material ist recht steif so dauert es schon etwas lÃ¤nger bis der Schuh eingelaufen ist und anfangs kommt manein wenig schwer hinein Etwas flexibleres Matwerial wÃ¤re hier besserDie NÃ¤hte rundumwiesen keine MÃ¤ngel auch das hatte ja ein anderer Rezensent geschrieben hier zum GlÃ¼ck nicht Die Schuhe wurden schnell im Karton verpackt geliefert und passen perfekt Die Verarbeitung ist sauber und das Modell gÃ¼nstiger als im Laden Dank der grauen Farbe passt der Sneaker zu jedem Outfit Sehr bequemer Tragekomfort Son zapatillas de calle no para hacer deporte Son muy cÃ³modas estÃ¡n bien acabadas y son muy

irrÃ©sistible cest vrai quelles sont confortables et la semelle est Ã©paisse et souple Le problÃ¨me de ces sandales cest quelles sont un hybride rÃ¢tÃ© entre la sandale classique et la sandale de

Preis unmÃ¶glicher Schuh Sehr schÃ¶n Bought these for outdoor wear I have purchased NB shoes in the past with no problem but I sent these back the same day I received them I read the reviews re tendency to run small So I ordered a size larger length and instead of my usual 4E I ordered 6E  Waaaay to tight To the point it was ridiculous Figured they gave me the wrong size Nope Right there on the label When 1 person says theyre to tight thats one thing When a dozen people say it something is wrong NB should be ashamed I have big fat flat Fred Flintstone kind of feet  On top of that Ive developed Plantar Fascitis  after 50 years of working on my feet  I tried multiple boots and found no comfort  For anyone with wide feet you know its hard to find much selection for you and its worse when youre trying to find something comfortable too  I measure that I should need a 105 EEE shoe  I bought these in 11  6E and I finally have some comfort   So far Ive worn them daily for 3 months and may have to replace the footbed inserts soon but they have been the best boots Ive worn in many years  Bought these because they are one of the few wide shoes made with good ankle support However the design is not a good one for men with wide feet  The tongue of the shoe is sewn to the sides  making it difficult to put the shoe on and uncomfortable across the top of the foot It also is very narrow I measured the sole of a size 11 6E against a pair of New Balance size 11D shoes and the difference in width was negligible  The insole they put inside is actually too wide for the shoe itselfJust really bad execution of a great idea Working a job where Im on my feet for 90 of the time I needed a pair of boots that didnt kill my feet and these are the ones I found after a long search I can wear these boots all day and not have any pain which is a first for me I actually prefer to wear these as my every day foot wear now because theyre actually more comfortable than my regular shoes which is a mind blower I wish they came in more colors though Wide enough to fit comfortably But just a little bigger than I need The caveat My feet are all kinds of chewed apart My history includes Paperboy Baltimore MD from ages 814 Yearround athlete ages 816 Landscaper ages 1318 Restaurant Staff ages 1619 Furniture DeliveryTruck Driver ages 18 25 Soldier ages 2534 Medical Staff Multiple Services ages 2552 and beyondI think I need â\\x80\\x9cspecialized shoesâ\\x80\\x9d from now on So for my needs EXCELLENT SHOE over the counter I need a prescription about 20 years agoHUAAAAAAAAHHHHHHThank you New Balance for the acknowledgment that WIDE FEET EXISTHello EVERY other shoe brand  IN THE WORLD   PAY ATTENTION dummy Im happy with the purchase though next time I might go up to the 6E instead of sticking with the 4E version They seem to run a little narrow for my taste Otherwisetheyre the real deal I wear them to work and I pull 12 hour nights shifts at a hospital I was looking for something that had really good support and were a good solid stable foundation to work off when moving patients These do the trick Poorly manufactured  We purchased for our grandson and after he wore them 23 times the ankle area of the inner left boot ripped after he tripped over a branch  So disappointed with this boot because we have other New Balance shoes and encountered no problems  I hope we can return because it says the return window is closed The leather is very thing and fragile There is a rubber label on the tongue that gets bunched up so I removed them The tongue of the show has to be sort of crunched into the shoeFortunately I got these for 45 as a usedlike new item so I am overall happy Ipurchased these primarily because of the new balance name  I am GREATLY disappointed  The soles of the boots have separated from the rest of the shoe and this happened within first 6months of almost daily use  I can not believe how poorly manufactured these are especially with the New Balance Name Great except slippery on wet rocks packed snow and ice Not a good winter sole Ich habe nur 4 Sterne von 5 vergeben weil die Einlegesohle fest verklebt ist und orthopÃ¤dische Einlagen nicht mehr in den Schuh passen Ich habe schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe und der Schuh hat mir perfekt gepaÃ\\x9ft Aber er muÃ\\x9f 1 bis 15 SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt werden Das Obermaterial ist sehr

ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d Adidas quality at its best I like the design and sole used in this shoe My daughter uses it for when playing tennis and similarly with badminton She feels the comfort and high quality that adidas is known for It is difficult to get my fee into them and when I do I feel like I have boats on Love this shoe  Helps keep good balance while playing tennis Love  Great foot stability Shoes are comfortable but they arenâ\\x80\\x99t even 2 months old and the design of the shoe is causing the material at the ankle to fatigue It bends every step I take Disappointing PensÃ© que eran originales y de piel como los de adulto y me salieron clonados y de piel sintÃ©tica My kid burns through shoes pretty fast Im now adding Kswiss to the list of name brand shoes that just arent made like they used to be They survived about a month with medium wear Do not recommend getting your 8 year old shoes that have cloth loops for laces 2 of them ripped out and now my kid cant tie them up Had to drill holes in them to use for the laces and a decent pair of school shoes are now play shoes Nice try KSwiss you can go sit on the bench with the sketchers  adidas Guess we will stick with Nike  Puma for awhile Im a big fan of the ST329 by Kswiss  Ive had 8 or 9 pairs over the last 11 years  My son asked if they make them in his size  Well whaddya know they doOn the first day of kindergarten my big boy got to wear the most comfortable sneakers hes ever worn Grandson loves them  They fit him very good a bit too narrow and or seems to run a bit small This is the second pair of these that I have purchased and my 13 year old loves them Awesome quality fit perfect my son loves them I would definitely buy again Perfect my son loves them Absolutely love Appena arrivate un giorno

sehr schÃ¶n passt perfekt Muy suave  perfecto It is very uncomfortable shoes  I doubt itâ\\x80\\x99s organelle or notInfact will write to Puma to look into Calidad esperada de una marca como Adidas SÃºper cÃ³modos Muy buena compra a un precio accesible Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had these shoes for about a month now and Really loving them As far as I can tell these are legit Adidas They are comfy and so cute Iâ\\x80\\x99m not really a runner I bought these shoes mostly for style but i gotta say I never realized how much a shoe matters in running until I bought these Definitely good for running They have like a honeycomb sole at the ball and heel of the shoe to lessen impact Like I said super comfyI have noticed the shoe lace issue some reviews mentioned but nothing a little double knot canâ\\x80\\x99t fixAll in all I love these shoes I had a new pair of these and my college D1 athlete came home due to the quarantine  sheâ\\x80\\x99s a swimmer  suddenly turned runner she swiped my shoes  Took me a while to find the exact shoe but I did and now I have my running shoes back  Very hard to purchase shoes when you canâ\\x80\\x99t try them on  These shoes have a soft upper that does not rub or irritate and they have a soft wide heel for the trail running I like  They are a bit heavy but that is because the heel is solid  The laces are a bit odd for a runner but once adjusted the upper combined with the shock absorption of the soul of the shoe makes it worth the time  I have a narrow heel and it slips if not tied properly  I am a size 10 and I have enough room in the toe for long runs I was so excited to find one if my fav shoes in stock since Im pretty sure its been discontinued Unfortunately they arrived USED with some pretty gross looking unidentifiable crud on the bottom of the shoes I uploaded pics but they dont really pic up the texture My closest guesses to what was on the bottom is dried mud paper mache and spider webs The shoe packing that normally goes inside new shoes was missing too Im so bummed I shouldve known it was too good to be true  First of all I was so surprised how quickly these arrived considering the virus crisis which says great things about this seller I was really happy to get them so fast because I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t really start my marathon training program until I had the shoesAs for the product itself  this is my second pair of pure boost go  they are great for long distance runs Lots of cushion  my last pair didnâ\\x80\\x99t give out on me until after 9 months of very heavy use Iâ\\x80\\x99m still able to use my last pair  for waking  shorter runs but can feel it in my feet  knees that they are on their way out so Iâ\\x80\\x99m rotating the new pair in for the high mileage runsI can recommend both seller  shoes Order 12 size down  Absolutely one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased Updated after finally breaking these shoes in it took longer than expected I changed my review from 1 star to 4 I still think the ultra boosts are better and have an extra bounce but overall these shoes are quite comfortable and great for running and walkingOriginal review I decided to try the pureboost for a walking shoe since I absolutely love my adidas ultraboosts I have had six pairs for running I assumed they would be similar but they are not at all I wore them out for a 5 mile walk and they destroyed the back of my heel The shoes are not comfortable If you are between these and the ultraboosts i highly recommend spending the extra money to get the ultraboosts They are the most comfortable runningwalking shoe i have ever had and worth every penny This shoe was way too large I have always ordered my running shoes a full size larger Did the same with these shows but they were so large they looked like clown shoes Sent them back immediately Light weight shoe but great shoe Super comfortable for walking or running Great for normal to wide feet May run a half size bigger for skinny feet Would recommend and purchase again Anni fa comprai le mizuno wave 17 ad dir poco eccezionali oltre che comodePresi il numero 45 e mi trovai veramente beneOggi dopo tanti anni ho avevo

has an airy design and is very comfortable too if you have a high instep Like many shoe companies now Skechers skimps on Velcro saving a fraction of a cent but making the shoes unwearable unless you have lowprofile feet Yet at the same time theres way more Velcro than would ever be needed on the heel strapThere are also prominent ridges across the sandals separating the toes from the rest of the foot as well as another ridge between the large toe and the remaining toes So unless you have perfectly average feet you may find those uncomfortableThe relaxed fit is a nice idea just poorly executed in lacking sufficient Velcro Skechers is my favorite brand My son loves these shoes They are comfortable and fit well My son tends to be particular about how his shoes fit and he loves these We have bought several pairs as he grows He is on pair 3 just due to growing into bigger sizes They seem to wear down as expected He wears the shoes everyday and is rough on them but they hold up Over time they do start show some of the wear and tear but not more than expected based on his use Second pair of these They donâ\\x80\\x99t scuff easy like some of the cheaper tennis shoes for toddlers They are sturdy and fit well Unfortunately the sole comes right out so if you have a kid that likes to take off their shoes you could find one sole mysteriously disappears during daycare one day Under the sole is rock hard so you canâ\\x80\\x99t continue wearing them unless you can find a similar replacement sole Espectacularson una pasadame han encantadode talla idealyo uso un 38 y me quedan bienson

in this brandstyle Great buy and i know they will last well Me han encantado SuperÃ³ mis expectativas Muy contenta con la compraLo que si me las noto un pelin grandecitas I got these for my son as his first real shoes  They were a great fit and stayed on very well  He did not seem to mind these as much as he did his other baby shoes  The color of these was nice and complimented a lot of things  The Velcro worked well and held the shoes on even when he tried to pull them off  The inside felt cushioned and the shoes were easy to bend Preciosas me encantan y quedan super bien  comodÃ\\xadsimas es el tercer par de esta marca y nunca decepcionaGracias Gioseppo ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8d Great shoe My infant girl wears a size 2 and it fits her perfectly and there is enough width for her foot to feel comfortable The style is super cute too Kedan genial My four year old has a few options in this brand and these are my favorites They wipe down rather easy and are adorable My child can get them on her feet and wears them without complaining  I like that the coloring has a sweet feminine touch to it  Packaging was great and they arrived quickly using Amazon Prime Son muy cÃ³modos vienen bien de talla y son mucho mÃ¡s guapos de lo que se ven en la foto Disappointed in these Size runs very small and inside space where foot goes is very short Also description says grey with hint of blue but they are grey and lilac purple Returned Perfecto I love this shoes  They look so nice on my son and as others have commented they are so easy to keep clean Even after spending time on the playground with dirt and mud  a quick rinse and wipe and they look new  I love them Quedan perfectos y muy buena calidad I am so disappointedThese shoes arenâ\\x80\\x99t cheap for a 2 year old and less than 1 month into use we have 5 pairs of shoes we rotate use of regularly in the same size the stitching at the toe has come undone and there is a big hole Me quedan perfectas My kid has pancake feet so I really have to shop around to get his kicks just right These are lightweight comfortable and not obnoxious The price was fantastic as well I would definitely buy these again in a different color Muy bien I wrote an earlier review giving these shoes 4 stars Im changing that to 2 Im giving them a 2 because they are comfortable as walking shoes The reason for the demotion is due to the mesh material they are subject to getting holes in them which is poor construction so my earlier praise is gone I was getting out of my car and bumped the door with my foot resulting in a small hole in the shoe at the toe Nothing you can do to fix it So now water comes in and you can see your foot or sock if white I missed the return date by one day Too much money to get holes in them You shouldnt go around being afraid of your shoe getting holes New Balance should know better and so should I I wanted to try these and was a skosh wary because theyre used but desc says like new and Amazon is the seller so what could go wrong right Received in a FLASH Wooo  got here in one day and I put em on with a shoe horn and wore em to a meeting last night Plenty confy and they look pretty good  My bride was surprised Id buy blue shoes let alone WEAR them Stylin R MeAs to used  one shoe has a crimp where the big toe goes and a spot with what could be a very light stain Bottoms dont look like theyve been worn much The crimp worried me but I didnt feel it at all and theyre really grippy on the floors So far so good And I can return em if something turns up For 40 quite pleased Longtime NB wearer never had tried this particular stylegiven my longstanding history of being very pleased with NB not to mention the price I bought them and have been fairly pleasedThey are super comfy and possess all the aspects of NB that I have grown accustomed tobut they fit a little strange Im a dude with a smallish foot size nine but that usually is a perfect fit with NB but these arrived and they seem to run a little big my foot slides around a bit more in these than other NB shoes for some reason I dunno I like em enough i work as a nurse so being on my feet for 12 hours a shift they are still super comfortable and Ive just gotten used to the larger fitting size I was looking for a comfortable show that can be worn around the house and for short trips to the market or shops This one is perfect Very comfortable sole and structure Does not fell sloppy and holds foot firmly but gently in place New Balance makes great shoes and these are no exception Very good quality and all the details are properly done Description of width was confusing requiring me to buy at a slightly higher price with free return  Width is fine and comparatively easy to make small adjustments using laces Shoe specified slip on construction Maybe I am too literal but I thought this meant the shoe just slipped on and did not have laces to tie The picture made it look similar to other shoes that have the lace look but no actual shoe lace to tie This is not the case I am sure these are perfectly fine sneaker but not for someone who does not have the dexterity to ties a shoe Not quite as wide as I expected for a wide and itâ\\x80\\x99s difficult getting my feet into because the opening is a bit small but once theyâ\\x80\\x99re on omg are these shoes comfortable  Itâ\\x80\\x99s like wearing supportive slippers that are socially acceptable  My feet are very grateful I bought these The material at the toe of the shoe is very loose and stretchy  As I ran my feet from my arch forward felt too loose  In fact my toes crept forward over the outline of the sole of the shoe and were making contact with the ground with only the mesh as a barrier  Tightening my laces did not help the issue  For me these shoes are useless for any type of exercise  Theyve already been demoted to dog walking shoes in this new role they do fine Great running shoe  only annoying thing is the shoelaces come untied when running Get a new pair of laces or double knot I love Amazon for shoes my size 15D  New Balance always fits me well and these were priced so well I had to get a pair  These shoes are perfect Pensavo che stavo acquistando i soliti stivaletti ma la fattura e i materiali mi hanno lasciato senza parole Sono tecnici ma allo stesso tempo eleganti senza tempo Non temono freddo e pioggia Comodissimi Cercate di chiuderle cosÃ¬ che la cerniera non dia fastidio Dopo qualche volta capirete come vi vestono meglio La scarpa Ã¨ molto bella purtroppo mi Ã¨ arrivata un numero piÃ¹ grande e la confezione lasciava molto a desiderare Unica cosa positiva il prezzo scontato Hacemos un pedido del 445 llega un 46 Al tramitar cambio el precio se dispara scarpa calda con il freddo e con pioggia piede asciutto Absolutely waterproof and stylishperfect combination  Got caught in a downpour and feet were loving the dryness  Jeans were soaked but feetsocks were perfectly dry  Great product Ich habe die Schuhe

schÃ¶ne Schuhe aus Leder Ã¤hnlich Hogan Perfetto Perfette MeEncantaron After this purchase Im not sure Ill purchase another pair of adidas with this pair being my first The sneakers fit weird as in the sizing I am a 10 12 11 in women I has to order the sneaker three times and just gave up or in with a size 8 men The sole has nice cushion but the toes area doesnt as much like the sneaker has an incline making it uncomfortable to walk in for a long period of time The style and colors I love Hope I didnt confuse anyone maybe if it was in women sizes the fit would have been some what better but then again the sole is weird Okay Truth be told Originally found these Ultra Cool Adidas Ninja shoes at the Adidas Outlet Store in Cabazon CA HOWEVER They did NOT have my correct size  were not able to ever get again So looked for lowest price all over the Internet Was happy to find on Amazon for a decent price  did not get upset considering the 8800 cost at Outlet Store All I can say is  Thank You  They fit Perfectly  Very comfortable  snug as a glove Great Color too  Peace  ð\\x9f\\x92\\x96 Andrew Jð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a My husband had to have them for today and they arrived yesterday otherwise I would have returned them They were very clearly a return as they were dirty inside including hair and one of the soles were out halfway and are super sticky on the underside so they are not supposed to be removed Right from the get go put them on and wore them 8 hours Even better than that orangeblue of the 2x foam I wear at work If your knees are going out like my knees they are the shoes to wearAdidas always seems to be a true fit for me  wearing a 95 Fits bigger than the other 4 pairs of Adidas mens 10s I own Seems about a half size bigger Love the appearance but one part of the hot pink is coming unglued after 2 days of wear Super comfortable kicks and they look Awesome There are no dislikes every step is with cushion like feel These have become my favorites I never had shoes this comfy Definitely buy another pair Walking on clouds I very highly recommend the Morrison3 sneaker These fit great and true to size They are comfortable and I like that they breathe I have had these in several colors and I am always thinking of additional colors that I would like to purchase Saca ampollas I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on  They were quite snug  I assumed my first mistake that they would stretch and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen  So off came the tags and I wore them outUnfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp  In particular the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point  Since I now had 140 of unreturnable shoe I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section This let the liner stretch slightly but not enough  Even in my older thinner orthotics and trouser socks the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area because they are unusable for me in their current fitClark shoes run a bit small and narrow in my experience so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width  This portion fit as expected  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support these shoes might work for you  The rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than theseTLDR  dont buy if you wear custom orthotics dont buy if you pronate dont believe they will stretch when you try them on These shoes felt a little snug when I first got them I wore them around the house to make sure they were a good fit I decided to take a chance on them and wear them the whole next day They really adjusted well to my feet and I am pleased I like that you can order Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s in a wide I have a narrow foot and Clarks usually fit perfectly but these are tight and not adjustable because of the elastic band  Super cute and well made Too small so it feels too narrow â\\x98\\x86â\\x98\\x86â\\x98\\x86Want it Short and sweetOKLEATHER QUALITY  EXCELLENTSOLE QUALITY EXCELLENTLINING QUALITY  VERY GOODDESIGN AND LOOKS  VERY GOODBANG FOR THE BUCK  VERY LOUDDURABILITY  ITS A HUSH PUPPIESI HAVE 4 PAIRS OF  HUSH PUPPIES and have been wearing them for 3 years  They will last 7 more years No Problem One of the eyelets came off the first time I laced the shoes  There is a flaw in the design Poor quality Cool boots The sole came detached after wearing these for 2 days only Schuhe sind wie zu erwarten bequem und haben eine tolle Passform Sind auch ziemlich leicht also perfekt zum Sport machen Die Farbe des Schuhe ist auch mit der Abbildung Ã¼bereinstimmend Einen Minuspunkt gibt es zur Pflege da die Schuhe sehr schnell stark verschmutzen leiht aber generell am Material Ich bin eigentlich Ã¼berhaupt kein Fan von Turnschuhen  sie sehen mir einfach immer viel zu klobig aus und unschÃ¶nAber diese hier sehen super schÃ¶n aus sind mega bequem und stehen mir sehr gut Ja die Schuhe passen sind aber nicht so schÃ¶n wie andere KangaROOS die ich besitzeZiemlich klobiges Design Preis war aber okay Sehr empfindliches Obermaterial Ich war mit allem sehr zufrieden und habe nichts zu beanstanden ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d tolle Preisleitungschuhe passen gut man lÃ¤uft prima drin und sie sind auch nicht empfindlichbin Rundum zufrieden FÃ¼r den Preis sehr gute Schuhe und bequem zu tragen Legere et souple Just received these shoes today it was delivered earlier than usual I have small feet a size 5 or 55 so I ordered a size 6 It was still tight so I am returning but what realllly bothered me was that itâ\\x80\\x99s yellow on parts of the shoe Donâ\\x80\\x99t like that at all looks dirty already I absolutely love these shoes Ive ordered 3 different pairs and wear them all the time I prefer the canvas ones to the other kinds they just feel a bit more comfortable Im on my feet almost all day and they never hurt when wearing these I usually wear a 7 or 75 and these got perfectly I usually wear a 75 or 8 tops so I ordered an 85 as the reviews suggested and they fit perfectly They are also thin like people say but I have skies for feet so wasnt a problem for me Not the comfiest but they look awesome They are for show not going on hikes lol White is really crisp Got what I expected after the reviews and at this price point Stark white sneakers will pretty much pull together any outfit  resulting in a classic casual and effortless vibeThey are a musthave in my shoe collection I prefer to rebuy cheap white fashion sneakers as white well doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really keep itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cwhiteout whiteâ\\x80\\x9d for very longThese shoes hold up very well I use them strictly for fashion purposes and are comfortable for that purpose A little bit more sparkly than I was expecting the photo of the rose gold lurex didnt look sparkly to me in the picture but thats okay because theyre still cute Im usually an 85 so I ordered an 85 and they fit perfectly Love these shoes They are a bit to big would recommand half a point under but Ive correct it by adding a sole and they are perfect for work Confortable and chic Note that they are very shinny but I didnt mind they look great with jeans I was unable to get the shoes on they were so narrow althoughI had ordered in my regular sizeI would not recommend  this product They look great just what I needed I feel like they really need a cushioned insole or are uncomfortable and they were a bit on the bigger side but that is an easy fix Very cute shoe Fits a bit on the smaller side would recommend ordering a half size up For the price the product is good however the shoe has lower breathability compared to other brands which makes it a good shoe for fashion but not if you are going out  walking for a long time Love these and the silver so sparkles  unique  bling blingComfortable and lightweight Muy buenos tenis The shoes were great but the box was completely destroyed When I ordered the shoe it was from Adidas Harden Vol 4 however it said in my order history that the shoe was Adidas Menâ\\x80\\x99s Crazy X 4 and it was sold by Shoe Cago I was so confused and thought I was scammed When I received the shoe I was expecting it to be some other adidas shoes but it turned out to be the Harden Vol 4 After doing research I found out that some other companies called the Harden Vol 4 â\\x80\\x9cCrazy X 4â\\x80\\x9d I checked the shoes and theyâ\\x80\\x99re legit Harden Vol 4 but still they should fix this and make it clear if this is sold by Adidas or Shoe Cago and fix the name Muy comodas gran calidad tienen buen ajuste originales definitivamente These shoes fit great and are stylish Great purchase  No se ve muy bien puesto es muy anchose  ve mal Great color Awesome shoes look great quick to ship I needed 12 size bigger I think Really love the look Bought it for my son apparently there the current rage good shoe but wish

les jours Los acabados la calidad y precio y los uso pra todo el dÃ\\xada y muy muy cÃ³modos I have found them very comfortable tres satisfaite du produit Merci Super cute and very comfy  My only complaint is I can not get my foot in with the tongue of the shoe getting pushed all the way up to the toe  Thinking about trying to glue it down ZunÃ¤chst vorneweg der Schuh ist super passt wie erwartet und ist komfortabel und schick VerarbeitungsqualitÃ¤t lÃ¤sst keine WÃ¼nsche offen Dh der Schuh selbst verdient keine 1Stern Bewertung aber man kann nur das Produkt bewerten und nicht das Kauferlebnis selbst Das ist ja grundsÃ¤tzlich bei Amazon hervorragend und ich bezeichne mich selbst eher als AmazonJunkie als AmazonKunde aber was diesmal mit der PrimeWardrobe Bestellung passiert ist ist denke ich eine Rezension wert denn das geht gar nicht weiÃ\\x9f nicht so recht wo der Fehler ist das muss Amazon versuchen zu lÃ¶sen Folgendes ist passiert Sehe den Schuh zum sensationellen Preis von 79 EUR bei Zalando war er deutlich teurer und lege ihn in den Warenkorb Es wurde mir angeboten direkt zu dem Preis zu kaufen oder in Wardrobe zu dem Preise zur Anprobe Denke mir nichts und lege ihn in Wardrobe kÃ¶nnt ja sein dass er nicht passt also nutze ich doch den komfortablen â\\x80\\x9eZurProbe Bestellwegâ\\x80\\x9c Schwups bestellt und bekomme per Mail die BestÃ¤tigung aber ohne Preis 000 EUR wurde abgebucht steht da nur in der BestÃ¤tigung denke mir nichts denn habe ja fÃ¼r 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt also wird es schon passen DrÃ¼cke nochmal auf den Artikel und sehe Preis liegt jetzt bei 87 EUR ok denke ich da habe ich ja nochmals GlÃ¼ck gehabt und einen richtig guten Preis bekommen Denkste Heute Schuh bekommen passt perfekt also gleich ins AmazonKonto und Schuh behalten drÃ¼cken aber was steht da Schuh fÃ¼r 87 EUR kaufen oder zurÃ¼ckschicken Hmm aber ich habe doch fÃ¼r 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt und bestellt Aber nirgends ist ein Beweis dafÃ¼r zu finden Im Kundenkonto steht 87 EUR und in der BestÃ¤tigungsmail kein Preis Habe das doch nicht getrÃ¤umt also Kundenservice angerufen aber nichts zu machen Ich kann gerne zurÃ¼ckschicken die 87 EUR ist der Preis Ok das war kein besonders gutes Kauferlebnis muss ich jetzt die Preise abfotografieren nach der Bestellung Na egal habe den Schuh trotzdem bezahlt er war auch mit 87 EUR sehr gÃ¼nstig aber Ã¤hnlich Zalando 89 EUR was aber gar nicht entscheidend ist wegen ein paar EUR mehr oder weniger Aber sehr unbefriedigend ist schon das man Artikel zu einem bestimmten Preis in den Warenkorb legt und dann offensichtlich ohne es zu merken oder den Preis bestÃ¤tigt zu bekommen zu einem anderen Preis bestellt bzw dann den Kauf abschlieÃ\\x9fen muss Das geht so nicht Habe definitiv beim Abschicken der Bestellung Knopf jetzt Bestellen den Preis von 79 EUR angezeigt bekommen und erwarte dann auch dass ich zu dem Preis kaufe und kein anderer auch wenn Preise â\\x80\\x9eim Hintergrundâ\\x80\\x9c schwanken Aus meiner Sicht ein Fehler im System und fÃ¼r mich ein Grund Wardrobe nicht zu nutzen Also Vorsicht beim Bestellen Ã¼ber Wardrobe Keine Ahnung ob ich ein Einzelfall bin oder andere auch schon diese Erfahrung gemacht haben definitiv muss Amazon aber hier am System nachbessern No es la primera vez que compro zapatos de esta marca pero estos llegaron en una caja distinta no de la marca una caja de amazon y sucio uno de los tenis como que  usaron 1 o 2 veces se notaba que pisaron con el Es sind schÃ¶ne Schuhe die auch sehr wertig Aussehen und sich nach dem Eintragen gut anfÃ¼hlenLeider ist vor kurzem eine Naht geplatzt und damit auch gleich der Schuh offenKeine zusÃ¤tzliche Verleimung etc sondern die EINFACH GENÃ\\x84HTE ZIERNAHT ist an dieser Stelle alles was den Schuh zusammenhÃ¤ltSie sehen Wertig aus ohne wirklich Substanz dahinter zu haben Ich werde mich wohl nach einem Schuh made in EU umschauen Bonitos cÃ³modo y amplio pedir talla habitual de zapatos Bin immer sehr skeptisch bei Schuhen online bestellen Aber dieser reingeschlÃ¼pft und fast wie angefertigtAuch das Laufen ist sehr sehr gut Absolut zu empfehlen Zufrieden Die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe schwitzen darin Luft undurchlÃ¤ssig Keine Empfehlung Beautiful â\\x80\\x9cI wear size is 9 base on the chart size I take 85 but the material the rubber soles are too hard in general the whole material Zum Top  Preis  super Schuhe nan Guter Tragecomfort auch bei lÃ¤ngerem Spaziergang gute QualitÃ¤t kann Ich nur weiter empfehlen I like the design The size is bigger than expected The price is fluctuated by color and sizes and time that the order is made Top QualitÃ¤t super Schuh passt super zum Anzug  Small wide they are very thin Dieser Schuh fallt eher kleiner ausIst fÃ¼r Schlange FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe eher geeignetDie Sohle ist eher etwas hÃ¤rter das sich im Tragekomfort negativ auslegt These shoes was perfect for my Ck outfitwent very well They were cute and different Everyone love themasked where I get them ftom Die Schuhe wurden super schnell geliefert und sitzen super QualitÃ¤t richtig gut I love them In liked the appearance and material of the shoes Disappointed that the shoe didnâ\\x80\\x99t fit Danke schÃ¶n  First off I didnt need these shoes But as they offered a stylish upgrade at an excellent price I couldnt say noAs I do with any pair of Clarks I ordered a half size smaller than my normal size and these fit perfectly Plus theyre wellmade comfortable and versatile enough that I can wear them with jeans or a suit And did I mention the price was a stealIf you need to up your shoe game for a budgetfriendly price this is the pair of shoes to do it I ordered this in tan to replace a shoe I ordered in a size 11  The size 11 shoe was tan  This shoe from this seller in a 10 12 is BROWN  there is a distinct color difference  Did not bother to send back  These shoes run about half a size too big  Waste of money for me this time Size way down Stunning shoes but I normally wear a 10 and the 9 12 fit like an 11 I might try a 9 if they come back on sale again I would have left 5 stars if the fit was better I purchased these for my husband because his dress shoes were old and ugly and dated They are classy they are comfortable and he looks way more modern The shipping was very bad The shoes box was ruined completely This style will never get old It is very nice and well made If you are thinking about buying it then do it you will have no regrets The shoe looks feels and  fits great Nice solid yet flexible shoe Great support Did not fit Written this before but it always bears repeating I HATE These kinds of reviewsTheyre loafer style sneakers Theyre black loafer style sneakers Theyre a nothing fancy wardrobe mainstay that you really dont think about much They wear out and you get new ones so what in the heck can you say other than that LolDesignwise they were smart and put in a scant little inch in the heel An inch isnt noticeable in the slightest you dont even conciously feel it but when you have a tendon problem in your foot or heel OMFG does that little inch make all the differenceThe designer was also thoughtful enough to make the interior sole ever so slightly fuzzy Anyone who has ever gone without socks in warm weather pretty common to do in this style of shoe know why thats a nice detail that is sadly lacking in a surprising number of shoesI know that doesnt bother a lot of women because they have forced themselves to get used to it but those hard interiors that make the inside all icky gross the instant your body even thinks about sweating drive me bonkers LolMaybe its the 110F summers where I live but whatever the reason I am always grateful for an all cloth interior for an enclosed shoe LolAnyway there wasnt any breaking in for me on these Another nice touch I was able to wear them straight out of the box as if I had them for yearsOn the other side of things they also seem to be wearing quite wellSo yeah they dont look like anything special and I guess in a way theyre kind of not but theyre nicely put together enough that you dont really think about them Well at least you dont unless youre sitting in front of a blank Amazon Review screen which for me at least proves that theyre actually a nice product that probably wont get nearly the reviews that they probably should  Everyone is being nice and saying These run small haha but I just ordered a size 8 and it doesnt even fit my sister who usually wears a 6 Same story with the other pair of shoes I bought from this brand This isnt just running small this is inaccurate sizing Shoes arent like clothes I know i have to be careful when i order pants or shirts because sizes can vary But in every other store on the planet earth I wear a size 8 US This is just inexcusable honestly Instead of expecting shoppers to order one size up how about you just measure the actual shoes and send them the right size These shoes are awesome I have wide feet and have been wearing Sketchers that never fit quit right so decided to try these Best fit Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever had They are made MUCH better I ordered 8W  Other shoes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve even tried 8WW but these are perfect  Wish I could find white ones Love them Even wide the toe band is way narrowOther than that theyre comfyVery well made Love these due to that they are so comfortable and easy to slip into I got them in black  then ordered them in blue I ordered my regular size Finally bought inexpensive narrow shoes  Didnâ\\x80\\x99t really care for color but wanted comfortable fit  These shoes are definitely perfect in that requirement Lifestride shoes caught my eye on sale in a physical shoe store but selection was very limited so I hoped to find them similarly priced online My usual size 95 felt a rather snug not necessarily uncomfortable short term but I could not guess well enough what it would cause during longer wear They seem to advertise having some kind of special arch support Im not blown away by that having said that I dont feel my feet fatigue either soo I guess thats workingOn here I chose to go to a size 10 narrow just in case 95 really was too snug Im happy I did The nose seems a little long but is just perfect while walking around I have weirdly narrow long feet that also tend to get ugly gaps with low cut shoes I still have some gaping but it isnt triggering me as much as it normally would The shoe cups and forms nicely around my feet no slipping off my heel yay and the leather is very soft Theyre absolutely worth a try Shoes were better than I expected Shoe fit true to size and had a great cushion at the bottom for support Love and would buy again Produit arrivÃ© une dizaine de jours avant la date prÃ©vue en super bon Ã©tat et soigneusement emballÃ© chaque support emballÃ© individuellement dans son papier Vraiment satisfaite de mon achat Parfait Son muy funcionales buen producto solo que no incluye los taquetes pero si los tornillos Muy bueno Todo en orden grxs Love these I ordered a 5 pack to keep my kids balls off the ground and looking a little more pottery Barn In fact I got the idea from pittry barn We live them are using them all They even hold the kids football helmets Super cute very strong and live that the cone with drywall screws too Used these to make a memorial board for my uncle who was also a coach The rings are very sturdy and look great The balls also sit in them well without falling However screws that come with them are cheap The drill striped the screws before they were driven even half way in resulting in a late night WalMart run Not a deal breaker but might be helpful info We bought these to hold our sons basketballs so that they werent always rolling around on the floor in our garage These are definitely suitable for displaying a trophy ball in a bedroom on the wall but we just wanted an inexpensive solution for our garage and these fit the bill We mounted these on a stud in the garage so they are very sturdy but still not meant for a lot of weight even more so if you were to mount them on an inside sheet rock wall even with wall anchors these are only meant for supporting the weight of ball not much more These are exactly what I was looking for  a minimalist way of storing mini basketballs The are super simple to install and look great Perfect size for what I needed For the price I do recommend them I did not use the anchors that came with them and instead used my own that were better for my walls Only 1 star deducted because one of them broke see pic after 8 months of use Its not a big deal because Im only using 3 and the package came with 5 so I just unscrewed the base of the broken one and installed one of the leftovers Bella sneakers e soprattutto ottimo prezzo I miei figli calzano da sempre primigi per cui sulla misura sono andata sul sicuro I dig these shoes  The color is great and slightly unique so you dont look like everyone else Plus they are very comfortable which is a bonus Nice look and very comfortable  I wear them all day in the office and have zero issues It runs have size bigger High quality lovely looking and very comfortableWill order more from Bugatti shoes I like the fact that size of all their shoes is constant Ich wusste was ich kaufe und es war drin was ich haben wollte Super Schuhe I want to love these They are very cushioned like you are on foam springs and they look amazing but thats it I feel like I can slip out of them or roll an ankle The shoe material is so stretchy it feels like a childs craft foam fabric which is great if you want light weight but seller is wrong to classify this as a crosstrainer It is for running IF that maybe just a pretty house slipper Also I have narrow feet but this is for people with like 2D feet Squishes down  from top to sole not width I usually fit size 9 these were 95Was going to return them but I do love how they look and they are comfy just not for any athletic I admit I bought these shoes because they look so cool and Ive always loved Reeboks comfort  And when I first put them on I loved them  But after walking around the house for an hour or so they felt so tight  The fabric really didnt stretch even as much as leather might  I bought an 8 12 which is 12 size larger than I normally buy so I didnt feel comfortable moving to a 9  It wasnt the length that was the problem they were just too inflexible  Sadly I sent them back These shoes look great and I enjoy the lack shoe laces butwhen I get to doing a fast pace walk or an incline walk I feel like Im walking at am angle Like Im about to roll my ankle I think Im going to stick to my other athletic shoes for workouts These are still cute for around town though First of all I love the designSecondly the comfortness is great Soles are bouncy and the sneakers overall is very lightMy size 75 US women and 39 as Europe women sizeI have been using for about two weeks therefore I can not tell if they are longlasting or not But hopefully they will last for about 23 years Because I love the design and texture of the sneakers so muchThe color white get dirty easily so not recommend to run on rainy dayAnd 50 for this cool pair of sneakers I must say it is a pretty nice price Running shoes have become quite expensive recently and price range are usually from 60 or above They are very comfortable and fit as expected For use around the house they are ok These are not for cross training The material is like neoprene and when working out or walking outside on slanted ground your foot slides all over These are so comfortable and flexible  I wear between an11 and 12 I ordered the 11 and after I broke them in they are wonderful  No blisters  no problems  And I absolutely love the style  they look amazing I like the way they look and they are comfortable however with the way the sole is it makes it very easy to roll ankles if you have weak ankles and they are not breathable The shoes stretchy material makes them tough to walk down hills with as I feel like my foot is going to fall out through the toe area Otherwise they are comfy and it feels like Im walking on clouds I think they run small or I didnt size myself correctly but its a hard to tell because the material of the toe of the shoe is so stretchy that what seemed OK at home and was comfortable actually wasnt when I went out on the trail Its great not to have to tie untie these shoes and they keep their shape These shoes are really good for runners The support for my arch has been amazing I will be purchasing another pair Been wearing ours for less than a month and during Virtual learning and they are a mess We donâ\\x80\\x99t really go places very often and they are wrecked I know my 7yo plays hard but I expect the shoes to last more than two months The front piece is almost dangling off and under that it looks like the mesh will rip I like the fit of the Adidas but I think we are going back to Nike for durability For the price you cant beat them Our son loves them and he is picky about shoes excelent soft good thanks Would order again great quality Picture shows good but in reality it looks ok and does not looks appealing I would skip this Greta shoes and my son loves them Unfortunately they run narrow Look great Good value They run slightly small Fits perfectly My kid loved the shoes easy to

puma shoes Great style too Check them out This shoe is so cute with skinny leg jeans I was not too thrilled with the inner sole because there really isnâ\\x80\\x99t one Inside feels unfinished to the bare foot I plan to purchase some inner soles to give this shoe a more completed feel Son perfectos VolverÃ\\xada a comprar EstÃ¡n hermosos  delicados Da wir in keinem GeschÃ¤ft unserer Stadt noch irgendwelche Gummistiefel fÃ¼r unsere Tochter gefunden haben weil ihre GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe schlicht und einfach stÃ¤ndig ausverkauft war haben wir uns entschlossen nun hier welche zu bestellen und sind wirklich vollkommen zufriedenDie Gummistiefel sind gut verarbeitet und vor allem wasserdicht sie passen perfekt und trotzdem bieten sie noch genug Platz fÃ¼r dicke Socken an kÃ¤lteren Tagen Zudem sehen sie wirklich schick aus und sind auch von der Verarbeitung her wirklich in OrdnungEbenso fand ich den Preis fÃ¼r die Stiefel angemessen und vollkommen in Ordnung so dass ich insgesamt nur die volle Punktzahl von 5 geben kann Unsere Tochter liebt diese Gummistiefel alleine wegen der Farbe und des Einhorn Die Stiefel machen einen guten und soliden Eindruck und sie hat nicht so schlimme SchwitzeFÃ¼Ã\\x9fe darin FÃ¼r den Preis definitiv eine Kaufempfehlung Comprati per mia figlia di 5 anni per le escursioni nei fiumi e per quando piove provati ottimo rapporto qualitÃ\\xa0 prezzo Linterno dello stivale rimane caldo e asciutto soprattutto Buona anche la suola con tacchetti che evitano cadute per scivolamentoBuon acquisto Abbiamo scelto questo prodotto perchÃ© alla nostra bimba piacciono molto i cavalli e gli unicorni e indubbiamente ne Ã¨ rimasta molto colpita e ha subito apprezzato gli stivali nuovipeccato che dopo il primo utilizzo di prova  nel giardino di casa in assenza di pozzanghere limmagine risulti giÃ\\xa0 rovinata Peccato davveroVestibilitÃ¡ adatta Stivaletti dai colori vivaci e comodi la bambina li usa volentieri e ci cammina beneSimpatica la fantasia utilizzata e lunicorno e un piccolo bonus che piace ai bambiniI materiali non mi entusiasmano speriamo che durino nel tempo Buy the real size your child currently wears not bigger According to the measurment scheme attached to the page you should order at least one size bigger Wrong This is what I did and it was a mistake We kept the boots for the next season anyway we like the boots overall  and ordered one size smaller ti the right size my girls wear now Ich wollte diesesmal nicht auf den discounter zurÃ¼ckgreifen und testete diese Gummistiefel leider bin ich sehr enttÃ¤uscht Meine Tochter hat hinterher richtig nasse Socken da sie hier drin sehr stark schwitzt Das hatten wir bisher in keinen Schuhen bzw Stiefeln Boots have an awful odorat I take out from a plastic bag and they stayed all day out for aeration and nothing helped That awful odorat of chemical plastic is everywhere at the house unfortunately they will go backThe boots are for a large foot Die Optik des Stiefels hat uns gefallenAberDas Material ist nicht flexibel genug es biegt sich nicht beim Gehen AuÃ\\x9ferdem ist der Stiefel schwer fÃ¼r unsere 2jÃ¤hrige Tochter Ich habe mir die tollen Gummistiefel fÃ¼r meine Tochter bestellt Sie trÃ¤gt gerade GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 23 und ich hatte ihr eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer in 24 bestellt Da hier einige meinten die Stiefel fallen kleiner aus was ich aber garnicht zustimmen kann Die Stiefel kann sie dann im FrÃ¼hjahr anziehen bis dahin werden sie passen Behalten haben wir sie weil sie wirklich super schÃ¶n sind und auch von der QualitÃ¤t her einwandfrei Per ben due volte ho dovuto restituire larticolo Ordinato il n 42 ma Ã¨ arrivato il 41 Per la prima restituzione col cambio articolo ho parlato anche con unoperatrice amazon per essere sicuro mi venisse sostituito con la taglia giusta ma nulla da fare  la sostituzione Ã¨ stata fatta sempre con taglia errata Muy buena pinta suela blandita pero demasiado pequeÃ±o Talo 41 comprÃ© 41 y es pequeÃ±o lo devuelvo Desastre total No tienen ni dos meses y apenas los he usado y ya estÃ¡n despegados o rotos por el talÃ³n Belle e comode mio figlio ne Ã¨ soddisfatto Ottime Sneakers calzano bene e la suola interna Ã¨ molto comodo Preciosos Ordinato 425 Ricevuto 41Pero lo stile colore e qualitÃ\\xa0 sono top Per questo due e non solo una stella bellissime scarpe davvero comoda e molto minimal stile element nice Excelente producto Las zapatillas son muy bonitas pero es la segunda vez que intento comprarlas y se equivocan con la talla This shoe is sturdy well made and very attractive looks better in person than the photos It fit me well as far as length and width but unfortunately I had to return it because the left shoe was rubbing on my ankle bone I guess my heel was fitting too low allowing the shoe to be high enough to ride on the bone instead of under it An insert might have fixed the issue but I dont like altering new shoes Im sure this issue is my anatomy and not the shoe design Clarks are the best  Love this shoe  it has support is comfortable and the fit is exactly right I got a size 11 and had to send them back Couldnt even get my foot in them Overall theyre a cute shoe But wont work for me Loved the styling Sorry it was too short for my foot Fit more like a 10 Too small not the right shoe Really wanted to love these shoes Initially very comfortable After three weeks of daily wear on vacation body of shoe has stretched at least a full size with only walking Discovered after a light drizzle that soles have ZERO grip No me han gustado a los dos meses de uso estÃ¡n rotas por la puntera y solo las uso para correr y hacer deporte mÃ¡ximo dos horas al dÃ\\xada pÃ©sima calidad ni volverÃ¡ a comprarlas Very good I like to much Manque un peu de largeur mais c est une des deux marque que je prÃ©fÃ¨re pour travailler I Love these ASICS They are light  fit my feet perfectly  Perfect for 12 hour shifts on the frontline I really am impressed with this particular shoe I got these to replace my Gel Excite 7s after the quiz on the Asics website told me these would be my best fit I wanted something with more cushion than my last pair but theres nothing soft about these soles at all Its like running barefoot on pavement And the heel is so narrow when I run my heel goes over the sole and pinches between the sole and the shoe wall giving me blisters on the bottom of my heels Ive tried a few runs and they dont get better My knees and ankle hurt within the first mile due to lack of support I can feel the shock in my heels with every strike I wish I could return these Please dont waste your money on these These shoes are cute have a nice fit and are very comfortable I also appreciate that they donâ\\x80\\x99t make my size 10 feet look like I am wearing water skis I have worn them for weight lifting and running and have had no issues with rubbing or sore feet I tried 4 different shoes and ended up returning them all except this pair Theyve eased some of my joint pain in my knees  feet after long runs Definitely recommend Love these shoes Super bouncy and miraculously make my huge feet look small Absolutely love this shoe Will be ordering another pair Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ran in mine and am now using them for everything Super cute and light Took wearing them for about a week to get them broken in and to the max comfort level Tienen muy buena calidad y  se ajustan muy bien These look and feel fake Glue everywhere Another thing the insoles look as if it comes from a ten dollar made in china sneaker from a bargain store There is no name on it anywhere I remember reeboks having a name on the insoleDefinitely feels and looks cheap I bought these for home because I have Plantar Fasciitis and they even suck at home on hardwood floors Outside they feel even worst Oh and these things have 0 grip Lol The rubber slips as if its plastic ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8fð\\x9f\\x91\\x8eWaste of money I am a 775 in shoes  in Reebok have always worn 75 I saw the reviews warning that these ran small but the Mineral Mist in 75 was 22 sohad to try At first I thought they were just too small but a lot of that is their thickness  stiffness I decided I was keeping them anyway did I mention 22  within an hour of wearing them they felt fantastic  I think an 8 would have been loose They are gorgeous  the colors are as vibrant as pictured My only complaint was that the left shoe was just a teeny bit narrower across the top as you can see in my photo but it isnt noticeable unless youre looking for it And Im not giving up my 22 pair so Ill get over it I cant even deduct a star for itLove the retro style  great colors I would definitely recommend  wouldnt hesitate to repurchaseMy pix are with  without flash to show the color difference  the reflective strips Not just for hiking I absolutely love these boots I purchased them because I use to own quite a few pairs of Reebok shoes years ago and remembered how much I loved them and how comfortable they were and these are just as comfortable as I hoped they would be I specifically was looking for Reebok when I found these I wear an 8 and these in an 8 fit perfectly  I loved that they came with black and purple shoelaces This product looks very nice but it is not a comfortable shoe It desperately needs a comfortable insole as inside the shoe is very hard and it took a couple of days to break it in I thought it would be comfortable if I continued to wear them but that was not the case Too late to return them so I am stuck I do not recommend this shoe Love the colors and the height of the shoe The arch support is better than average I went a half size up from my normal size and they were on the large side After wearing them for an hour around the house the ball of my foot hurt terribly Had to return them Based on this experience I would steer clear of Reebock brand I bought these because  needed a good pair of rugged shoes for mowing These are perfect I wish they had my 7 12  size the they would fit perfectly But they only had an 8 so I wear thicker socks so my feet dont slide in them too much Very comfortable only took one time of wearing them that they became more relaxed Well worth the money Love everything about these except they are very wide where they lace up You pull the laces all the way right and they still is too much room The shoelaces come undone so face even loosen with a double knot That being said I love these shoes the color and width of the sole Very comfortable if they werenâ\\x80\\x99t so big by top of the shoe Love these a lot of support and they look great I am a true size 8  ordered 85 because of all the reviews saying to size up 12 size and Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I did they fit and I can wiggle my toes at the top I do think true size would have been too tight perhaps Love the color comfort and ankle support Caught these guys in sale and could not resist The review mentioned the sizes run small and I was worried because Im naturally a large size so I ordered an entire full size up and they fit perfectly Duraron como un mes o dos y luego se separÃ³ la suela del tenis sin ningÃºn esfuerzo Shoes came promptly and look great these are great  quite stylish and comfortable  People always ask where i got these from of course I dont tell them smiling Flash back to the 90â\\x80\\x99s I love the way they fit and feel on my feet I remember these back when I was in high school I love the look and theyre actually very comfortable I wear them for stylenostalgia Not for sports Great for the 80â\\x80\\x99s themed party I went to recently Love my BKs they are true to size and comfortable Seller shipped immediately via fed ex No issues Very narrow in the toe No cushion inside I love these shoes They were the perfect throwback to the look I was going for and turned out to be really comfortable also Iâ\\x80\\x99m always a getting people who stop and look and ask are those BKs and where did you find them Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking that I need all the colors So cute ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8d I love my new BK Great shoe bad lace lock stopped holding lace tight after a few weeks Tried to get replacement lace or lock but unsuccessful A bit disappointing for a pretty expensive toddler shoe Great fit and look Habe die Schuhe wieder zurÃ¼ckgeschicktwaren leider zu klein EstÃ¡n muy chulas aunqie un poco grandes Yo utilizo siempre en adidas 38 y 23 y son un poco grandes de lo habitual La talla es un poco mÃ¡s grande de lo normal sin embargo se ajustan perfectamente Top Bequem und leicht zu tragen Perfekt fÃ¼r LaufenSchÃ¶ne Farbe passt zu allem Perfecto para caminar pasear ir al campo senderos TrÃ¨s jolie basket et confortable je recommande Perfecto This shoe is as expected  1 affordable as I dont want to pay more than 40 for a good pair of shoes 2 ugly as sin  just as depicted and 3 comfortable  Welcome to being 45yo These were comfortable right out of the box and fit well I purchased a105 and I have a narrow foot I like the heel area because it really absorbs the shock I purchased them to be able to walk on a wooded trail I am able to comfortably walk over rocks roots and dirt with complete support and shock absorbing cushioning I have had these for 6 months and according to my pedometer I have put over a million steps on them and they are still as comfortable as when they were new  I would recommend these for trail use or even as a good walking shoe for pavement because of the cushioning I will purchase another pair when its time to replace these Hab 2 Jahre hintereinander das gleiche Modell bestellt fÃ¼r meinen Sohn da er relativ breite und hohe FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe hat Die Schuhe halten sehr gut warm und sind auch wasserdicht Kann ich nur empfehlen The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0prodotto

they look great Great product verdaderamente confortables y suaves para caminar The Stitching Came Apart after 1 Time Wearing it These shoes were much too large Amazing Loved the shoes Im not a dancer but Im wearing them as flats The seller was super diligent in connecting with me to make sure I understand how to measure I just based it on the measurement when I put a tape measure to my footSince Im wearing this as an everyday shoe Ive put in some insoles which have made them a bit tighter but the leather will eventually adjust Happy with my purchase Pros Made nicely seem like comfortable if it is your fitCons Run large My foot is 7 medium width After reading the reviews I went from 7 thats my Nikes Sketchersrelaxed fit sneakers size to 65 and they are still too big Should have ordered at least 6 And still the fit is interesting It is good that they have free return option with amazon prime cause it is not so easy to find your fit I am returning them and dont think I will order another size cause they dont feel right for Zumba slippery no ankle support But they might be good for other dancing lessons like ballet for nonprofs If your foot is narrow not high arch I would even recommend going from 7 to 6 cause in time they have a tendency to strech I can easily insert a finger photo included Bought these for my 16 year old son for a musical he is in  He normally wears an 11 12 in tennis shoe and the size 12 fit perfectly I needed to order jazz shoes for my daughter when she auditioned and earned a role for our local community theater It was a first time for us so I had no idea which of the shoes online to order Ultimately I decided on these based on the good reviews and Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I did They were perfect Fit as expected and good qualitytheyve stood up to the last three months of rehearsals and still look great For reference my daughter is a size 56 depending on the shoe The shoe looks like it is three times too smalluntil you put it on and realize that it stretches at the arch area to allow you to have a hell under your heel and a pad under the ball of your foot  Despite the heel and pad you will feel as it you are barefoot but that is part of the design so buy it if that is what you are looking for  If you wantneed something rigid that will offer support all around your foot this is NOT the shoe for you  It is essentially a leather sock with something solid underneath to withstand the wear of dancing on  If you plan on dancing a lot and want them to last then have a cobbler add leather or suede sole to the bottom surface floor contact so that they last  For the price just order another pair when these wear out  The fit is comfortable however you will want to insert some kind of liner in the front toe section of the shoe at the very least if not for odor management then for comfort The primary reason for this is the fact the very front of the shoe where the pads of your toes rest has NO insole only rippled leather extremely uncomfortable  The insole of the shoe falls short about 2 cm or maybe 1 of the very tip of the front of the shoe so the pads of your toes will press on the stictching and ribbed material where the leather shoe is sewn to the sole pad  Look at the pictures in the description  Where you see leather ripplesridges in the toe areathere is no liner sole or pad covering this area inside the shoe  Your toes will not be happy  An easy cheap solution is to purchase trim and insert thin shoe liners that reach all the way up to the front of the shoe and then you will be very happy with these shoes  They are great for practicing or even dancing socially but be careful that others do not step on your feet because you will have no protection for the top of your toes  Happy dancing The shoes seem fine but going by sizing guide they are too large  Especially considering you need to have them start out fitting very tight because they will stretch  I dont know any dancers who like their shoes to fit loose  sloppy  You want them to fit like a second skin to your feet  While your toes need to be able to spread you dont want your  feet sliding or slipping inside of the shoeWill need to return and order a smaller size  I ordered 7 12 and I wear a size 8 to 8 12 size street shoe but it is hard to compare that to dance shoes  Dance shoes need to fit different than street shoes  Also the lining inside one of the shoes was all bent up  would have been uncomfortable to wear  I hope the next pair will not have the lining rolling up Even in Chair Yoga we get out of the chair and do some standing poses  I wear a size 85 shoe but I need orthodics  in them So sometimes I have to go up a half size or even a full size  I ordered these and they fit perfect with my orthotics in them  They are super soft leather so its like I am barefoot with the support I need  I can do all of the seated and standing poses not perfectly but that would take a miracle My son dances a lot for musical theatre I just looked up this order and am amazed at how long they lasted well over a year but  the sole is getting worn down now They still look pretty good and support him but he is 15 and still growing so I think I probably ordered them on the large side but they are super comfy for him while dancing and if he forgets to take them to class he gets sore if he uses regular shoesBut I need to get the tan color instead of black so I remeasured his feet and will be ordering up by one size and definitely sticking with this brandFor the price I think these performed really wellall the seams are still perfect nothing ripped or torn just use shows wear on the soles and on the  leather part of the toe partly from his feet growing  For an adult or kid who dances more than him they will probably last for 6 12 months When new they look just like the picture shows and dont need to be broken in I followed directions and purchased the shoe a size or two up  I wear a 10 12 or 11 when its cut  small  i know to get a 12 or 13 because i have wide feet  But great quality  I have used the shoe many times  I will buy it again After reading many reviews I decided to just do what the manufacturer suggested I measured my daughters foot which heel to toe was exactly 9 34 inches Based on the manufacturers own guide I ordered an 85 for her In my gut I knew this had to be wrong as she usually wears 75 or 8 max But based on their own guidelines I went for it THEY WERE HUGE HUGE and HIDEOUS I wear a 9 and they were HUGE on ME She needed them asap so I hop on and order a size 75 thinking an entire size down would be better Wrong again The 75 were better but still and entire size too big for her At this point I gave up took her to our local dance store and ponied up the 15 extra they cost there vs these They fit great and are much more attractive I would not recommend these Not worth my time and now I have to send these monsters back lol Passt perfektIn Frankreich ist es unmÃ¶glich FuÃ\\x9fballschuhe

Lieferung mega Preis Passt gut und schnelle Lieferung Gute Beschreibung schnelle Lieferung und passt perfekt ð\\x9f\\x98\\x84 They are super comfortable like all of the Cloudstepper line I love that these are slip on but like all slip on shoes they dont provide a lot of side support That being said I have worn nothing else since buying them Who really wants to tie up shoelaces These are men of a certain age shoes and done well Didnt like the fit and look Had to return I have problem feet and order for house shoes  The shoes arrived and tried them on perfect  No break in period shoes were perfect  Will order again  Thanks for a great product It looks good Fitted as expect Just as advertised  fast delivery The cleats break and this is the second that it has done it in An sich ein hervorragender Schuh Material Verarbeitung  Futter Nur war er zu schwer zu schmal Schaft sowie vorne an den Zehen und das Futter war so dick dass er sich kaum hat schlieÃ\\x9fen lassen Bei dem stolzen Preis hÃ¤tte ich etwas mehr erwartet WunderschÃ¶ner kleiner Stiefel leider war die Sohle zu unbeweglich Mein Sohn konnte nicht mit laufendaher ging der Schuh zurÃ¼ck Sehr schÃ¶n das auch die Einlegesohlen mit demselben Fell ausgelegt sind Sehr empfehlenswert Der Schuh kam leider defekt an Die Sohle lÃ¶st sich an der Seite vom Schuh Great shoe for DH whoâ\\x80\\x99s recovering from knee replacement surgery  Comfortable with a good solid footbed easy on and off  As suggested I ordered a half size down from his usual and theyâ\\x80\\x99re a perfect fit  Fast delivery tooâ\\x80¦ thanks again Amazon Prime Very comfortable and light weight I ordered exact size extra wide Perfect fit These shoes are hard to find thank you amazon New Balance very well made and the right fit ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 Great shoes and service Everyday wear Comfortable and stylish for my son with autism  He has wide feet and plantar fasciitis which causes heel pain in addition to having discomfort from flat feet These are true to size well crafted and highly recommended I really love my old now discontinued 801 sliponclogs but needed a replacement  Whatever your regular NB sneaker size is should be appropriate for these Im usually a 105 in NB and tried a 105 and 11 in these  the 105 was the best one  That said they do fit differently than the 801s  your heel lifts out of the back more and the sneakers seem a little narrower even though both are D width  Its just a different design you get used to it enough  The new ones are more up to date so are better from a looks perspective These slips are really comfortable  however I wish I would have bought them a half size smaller  They fit perfect when I first bought them but after having them for about a month they have losened up As people have said you cant run in them well no kidding they are slides they will slide off your feet if you try to run in them As far as the low back ummm slides hello they are supposed to have a low back if you want something with a higher back by Shoes not SLIDES I would have give 5stars but the sizing issuse cot them a point After several months of pretty consistent use Love them no issue whatsoever They have worn as expected Im not working in them but I wear them for leisure consistently from the beach to the campground to around the house etc Picture is wear at about 4 months Back of heel cup is soft and does not rebound after being stepped onto as the older NB slipon did It was solid Iâ\\x80\\x99m hoping they bring back the old model which was built like my NB running shoe Outstanding Der Schuh ist kein Billigprodukt und auch nicht preiswert Aber genau der sollte es fÃ¼r den Sohn sein Da er Einlagen tragen muss haben wir ihn eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt und die vorhandenen Einlagen gegen die orthopÃ¤dischen ausgetauscht Da der Junior immer am Rennen ist muss der Schuh schon etwas mitmachen  und nicht nur gut aussehen Junior trÃ¤gt ihn nun zwei Monate und wir insbesondere er sind Ã¼beraus zufrieden Keine nassen oder kalten FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe okay hier ist auch noch kein Winter Also eine Empfehlung Toller Schuh gute Passform leicht und gute QualitÃ¤t Reduziert stimmt auch der PreisKlare Kaufempfehlung Calzan bien son cÃ³modos pero no son para entrenamiento Son pesados son para salir al dÃ\\xada a dÃ\\xada El color es muy lindo la talla ajusta perfecto son muy ligeros y sÃºper cÃ³modos Recomiendo su compra ampliamente me encantaron  tuve problemas con la paqueteria pero si llegaron  These shoes are beautiful and I do mean beautiful  They are also well made and the leather is supreme  However they  wear horribly They wear very hot and the shoes are extremely heavy  Within a week of wearing them I also developed plantar fasciitis I love these shoes so far I got the pale pink which is basically a neutral with my skin tone Iâ\\x80\\x99m between an 8 and 85 usually and size 8 fit perfectly Lots of support in these shoes too and soo comfortable My only worry is that the suede will show dirt quickly so I treated these with a suede protector and so far they are good The shoes are so comfy and I get a lot of compliments on these However these have zero suede The shoes are more of a final with a cushioned and comfortable lining Even the box says suede but there is no suede or leather on these ahoes Shoe is attractive seems true to size feels a bit heavy but I like a heavy shoe  I havent worn shoe yet but looks like there is no arch support if so Ill use an insert Good bargain for the price Not sure if real Reebok as logo missingfrom shoe but word Reebok is Imprinted on sole of shoe and it comes in Reebok box Cute and comfy They are a mix of leather and nylon Only thing is they are a little roomy for a 75 but I got them for a friend with wider feet so they will be good for her I would buy a 7 for myself Good Fits well I use this shoe when lifting weights at the gym or dancing because of its flatness Nice colors heard from others itâ\\x80\\x99s good quality Will update if any issues appear This Reebok is fire Excellent This is a work of art I love it It fits great I am a size 8 and i bought a size 8 and its just perfect I am severly excited about this pair of sneakers and would recommend it to anyone Viene reducido PerdÃ\\xad talla 255 cm y me mandaron 235 cm Lastima porque si estÃ¡n bonitos  Very nice tennis shoes My son loves them The color is what sold them and itâ\\x80\\x99s just ass vibrant in person Looks good on the foot These shoes are awesome so far I have Mortons neuroma in my foot so Im always looking for a shoe with a wider toe box and cushion I have played with these twice on hard court and I have had no toe jam and there is plenty of cushion I tried the B width as well but those were a little too snug The wide which felt really roomy but in the end worked great on court There is no break in period I am a 50 player and im rough on my shoes so we will see how well these hold up I was so excited to received these because they looked so cool and flashy but immediately after I tried them on they were super uncomfortable The crease just above the top of the laces cut into my toes when I would bend my feet to take a step I was surprised because the reviews claimed to be comfortable and did not need any breaking in I must have got a bad pair I returned them for a different brand entirely I bought these to replace my last pair of court shoes for pickleball  This time around Im spending more because these are to be good for my planter fasciitis  They feel comfortable just walking around the house  Cant wait to use them on the courts in the morning  They may be worth the extra I can live with just about any color if they fit right   I play tennis and this shoe is easy on my bunion and the knit material gives I can play without any bunion pain it is a wider shoe I ordered a 9B and it was perfect I first tried a pair of 85 wide in the Guavablack through the prime wardrobe  They were too big  I normally wear 8 wide but my arches have started to drop  getting flat footed so Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been trying a half size larger  I sent them back and tried the blacklime in 8 wide  I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get my foot into the shoe  They were very tight  I sent them back and ordered the guavablack in 85 wide again  I loved the color  Just a little out there for an old lady but I like them  The second pair fits great  There are differences in where the shoes are made and who made  them and what day it is  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a crap shoot  I do recommend this shoe  They are so comfortable on old feet  I love the guava color  Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten complements on them This would be a great shoe unless you have high arches There is NO arch support and they are sooo flat They are light and breathable and great in every other way But even with arch supports i had to send these back Definitely more cushion in heel and leaves arches and front foot feeling beat up The back material and the front material inside the shoe isnt sewn together It looks like to me it should be A plastic like material is showing BN wont answer phone Sent text and pics their website site said to do  no response I guess I need to send back Cant find out if it is a defect Poor workmanship even if it is suppose to be like this I got the extra wide 105 and it still feels a little tight The shoe strings are too short I had another pair of NB shoes in pass that the string whee too short I have to take the strings out of some of the whole to be able to have them loose enough to tie That pair was from 510 years ago Thought they would know by now to make their strings longer I have a high arch I dont know if that is the reason I need more string length but this is the only manufacturer that I have run into this problem If I but a pair of the mens I dont have that problem just some of their women tennis shoes I cant keep waiting for them to respond to tell me if this is a defect to send them back  Does anyone else that bought this show have the material inside the shoe look like this where the front material and the back material in the inside isnt sewn together Please someone let me know since I cant get a response from NB but the fit is perfect  Will definitely order this again  I was wearing Asics and the toe box on the Asics were so tight that I had horrible blisters  Switched to New Balance and wont go back  The color is BRIGHT pink  but I am gettin used to it I sometimes take a 6 medium width sometimes a 6 wide depending on the shoe  Ive had New Balance before and no issues  However this court shoe in a size 6 was ridiculously narrow I couldnt even get my foot into the shoe with the laces wide open  Sending back Love the comfort of these shoes Nice to actually feel comfortable in a pair of court shoes Besser als erwartet Top unf schnelle Lieferung Ordered a size down from what I usually wear and they fit perfectly The shoe does not look quite like the picture It is over sized and I believe that Daffy Duck was the foot model Unfortunately past the window to returnThese look like a KNOCKOFF I love them I read the reviews in advance and made sure to buy a size and a half smaller than I would usually wear They fit perfectly They look fashionable and feel comfortable Beautiful shoe but runs a bit large I had to return unfortunately I love the style the color the shape of this shoe but I unfortunately didnt read about the sizing on these until after I already ordered them and by then it was too late  But all the reviews are true  these shoes run really big  Im thinking a size 5 might do it for me normally I wear a 6 but in Adidas 55 seems to fit better over all  I ordered these in a 55 and they are considerably large  As I said thinking a size 5 might do it but not sure  Anyone considering these shoes please take heed  you will most likely need at least a half size below what you usually wear in Adidas I like the shoes  Iâ\\x80\\x99m just lucky I saw ahead of time that they run so big  The size 8 I just bought is the same maybe a little bigger than different pairs of size 9 adidas I have  I understand different brands can fit differently my doc martens are size 8 but I think itâ\\x80\\x99s weird to have so much variation in similar shoes of the same brand This shoe runs big I went out of the country and missed my return date Now Im stuck with an oversized brand new pair of shoes and most likely not going to get what I spent on it The shoe itself arrived ok It seemed like it can get damaged or bent super easily Either way not happy with the sizing difference Not even a little big its just too much This is so fake itâ\\x80\\x99s ridiculous Do not buy The tongue is a thin foam sheet with the adidas logo printed on it Not stitched Itâ\\x80\\x99s horrible and ugly and the sides have weird stitching Just a horrible product Iâ\\x80\\x99m surprised this came from amazon Disappointed â\\x98¹ï¸\\x8f They were embarrassingly squeaky They felt like they were made of cardboardâ\\x80\\x94especially the tongue of the shoe I returned them As others saidBefore it does run big I am normally size 859 and this shoesStill a tiny big for me but I am okay with itBut the shoes look just like in the picture  and are very comfortable I really like it Son preciosas sÃºper cÃ³modas me

sole had me slipping around in the turf indoor while Iâ\\x80\\x99m in goal I then got the same shoe with the turf soles and love them Someone else I know who Only plays on field Prefers the flat soles so they donâ\\x80\\x99t get caught in the turf So Iâ\\x80\\x99m happy they offer the shoe with both soles They were not comfortable They buckled up when I flexed by foot and was painful These are wide so maybe that is whyIt did have a nice solid sole that I think would have kept me front getting bruises on the bottom of my feet but the part where it buckled up on the top was too much These are nice shoes but I ordered them specifically because I am wide I would recommend sizing up 12 size when ordering I wish I would have ordered the 85 Muy buenos zapatos y la talla muy apropiada Very comfy

Although these are cute and very lightweight as other posters have said they run small In my case I ordered a size up and they were still too small  They also have a very narrow toebox which affects the fit as well The insole is definitely squishy however there is next to zero arch support This of course can be good for some people as can the narrow toebox  these would be great for one of my daughters however they are not available in her size  They do seem to be constructed well and feel sturdy although the sole is so light that it seems it would not hold up well over a few trail walks but I have to return these so I wont be able to find out for sure about that My biggest problem with these shoes was that they rubbed the back of my Achilles tendon area Maybe that only happens with some people I really dont know the reason That was pretty much all it took for me to stop wearing them They have a comfortable sole which is like memory foam or something The shoe is a bit narrow so if your feet swell from activity they may be a bit too tight at the end of your day I wore them hiking but theyre really more of a straight out walking and maybe running shoe I bought them in gray which was also a bit boring and made my foot look longer I love these shoes  However they do seem run a little small which is why I gave them 4 stars  I usually wear a 75 which is what I ordered  But I could tell when I first put them on that they were a little tight right up against my big toe The first day was the worst one They were already feeling tight but I jumped down to the ground from a platform to run to the car and as soon as I landed my big toenails and yes they were cut hit the toe of the shoe and I could feel that little bit of pain for the rest of the day  Its day three and I can tell theyve stretched a little bit but next time Ill try an 8 to be on the safe side  Otherwise they are extremely comfortable  Theyre very soft and very lightI hate wearing heavy clunky shoes  Theyre the perfect shape also  Not too small and thin like a simple pair of old school Keds but not too bulky that you feel like theyd only work with jeans or athletic wear I had on a nice grey tshirt and some kneelength jean shorts and they didnt make my feel look like giant boats  I would definitely order more in different colors I usually where heavy walking shoes with lots of padding plus custom orthopedic inserts so I was concerned that I would not be able to wear these very long  However the foot bed is very comfortable and I find that I forget I am wearing them  Although I checked the all day rather than couple of hours box I probably would not wear them all daybut definitely more than just a couple of hours My only complaint is that they only come in one width and for me are a little bit too narrow Ive begun walking at least 10000 stepsday and was developing severe blisters on the balls of my feet spreading to between my toes I thought I had a good pair of shoes but apparently not As soon as I put these shoes on for my first walk on the treadmill after receiving them it was as if the blisters were never there These shoes are extremely lightweight and so comfortable Ive been able to increase my walking and not have pain in my feet at all I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone You kind of feel the grid below the padding at the palm of the footSizing is right Looks like a good shoe But Im worried if the padding gets more compressed as one walks you feel the underneath grid even more   As soon as I put these babies on they felt like clouds They offered me tremendous support on my feet The color was a good color and the inside of the shoe is so soft I wished all shoes were like these soft and warm but pretty on the eyes These shoes are super lite have this great memory foam insole and have held up very well I used them for work in Healthcare Lots of walking But this would serve as a great running shoe as well I love the color the design and the fact that they are very light weight Like some other reviews stated they do seem to run small especially in the toes I had even ordered them a half size larger than I usually wear I like these shoes  I mainly walk for exercise and find them comfortable  The size 7 fits well in width but is a bit small for a walking shoe  The size 8 is a bit wide  Amy feet are narrow so it is not unusual to have width issues Der Schuh hat eine schÃ¶ne weiche Sohle wenn man Probleme mit den Fersen hat ist er einfach super Sehr angenehm zu tragen Los devolvÃ\\xad cuando llegaron vi que son brillosos estaba esperando algo negro liso Son amplios no los recomiendo para pie angosto son bonitos Too stiff to wear for an extended period of time and feel a bit clunky  I wish I would have sent them back instead of trying to wear them  Now Im stuck with them Purchased size 10 as other reviews said they ran large Big mistake Should have stuck with11 as they are somewhat narrow These shoes are a little stiff especially over tops of the feet but Im hoping they will get more comfortable over time with wear Good item It runs small and ripped up my heel as the back is hard Comfy and good quality At first glance I thought something was off with these black suede 1100s but I was not quite sure what was amiss So I got out my favorite blue suede 1100s for comparison see pictures1 The contours of the shoe were different from my blue pair of the 1100s2and upon closer inspection the insoles were also quite differentYou can see in the pictures my trusty blue suede 1100s come with a more expensive removable insole The difference in quality is clear but only because I have an authentic pair from a reputable brick and mortar store to compare the convincing knockoff 1100s to are the differences made apparentDont get me wrong I dont mind low cost replicas but I paid almost 140 with taxes for these This could just be a oneoff or perhaps knockoffs are going undetected more than I imagined Maybe the negative reviews for these shoes are actually for knockoffs and not the authentic NB productIn any event I highly recommend you visit your local brick and mortar retailer Call ahead and ask if they have the 1100s in your size and request they order them in all the colors you are interested in trying Thats how I ended up with the blue ones  Any local retailer still in business has to be doing something right and will be happy to order whatever you want I wish I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t worn them or Iâ\\x80\\x99d send them back  I ordered them as I kind of like the way they looked and I generally like NB Narrower than a normal D Uncomfortable on the TOP as the laces dig in some For me OK to wear if Iâ\\x80\\x99m only going to be in them a little while and not walking much Definitely not a walking shoeSo Ive had these a couple of months now and thought I would share what Ive foundThe good  they are cool looking i get comments every time I wear them and folks are surprised to see they are NBTheyve gotten a bit more comfy as they have worn in some but these are not shoes for being on your feet all day and they are definitely not a walking shoe Good for casual wearThe bad  the sole black rubber beneath the maroon sole separated at the front on both shoes rather soon I used some shoe glue Amazon and it did the trick but one would think they could have joined them better at manufacturingWould I buy them again maybe They do look good Do not fit like other NB shoes  They were very long  They felt like clown shoes  Sent hem back they even tried to charge me shipping  Complained and they relented I never wore these shoes My recent shoes from New Balance have all been size 13 4E extra wide I have several pairs of NB shoes in that size that fit me well These shoes were much too big I liked the way these shoes looked but didnt think it would be worth the trouble to try multiple sizes to see if I could find a pair that would fit I now have two pairs of these shoes and there is no doubt in my mind I will buy more  I will probably own every color 6 by the time Iâ\\x80\\x99m done thatâ\\x80\\x99s how great these shoes are  They are very comfortable as long as a proper insole is added I have to do this with all my work shoes as I walk 7 to 10 miles each day  I also recommend as others have getting the wide size Other than that they are super stylish comfy and well made Im a 105 EEEE and I buy these in 11 and they fit great look a little big but not crazy bigI wish new balance wouldnt cancel this line looks like they have and I wish they would make a cool boot in the same platform sole I love the New balance 1100 shoes I have them in blue black and brown my favorite  Theyre very comfortable and appropriate for my office or going out  Theyre great with jeans or cords or khakis wouldnt wear them with dressier pants I wanted to love these since Im a big New Balance fan and I like the idea of a quasi casual shoe for work but these werent as comfortable as I was hoping and I couldnt justify keeping them at 130 a set If they were under 100 andor had more of a sneaker feel I would have kept them probably Ive been looking for a classy yet very comfortable everyday shoe for awhile so I was glad when I found these They run true to size and are narrow If you have wide feet they might not work for you Ive been wearing these for the last few weeks and theyve held up well I plan to pickup a few additional ones to have Do feet a favor and buy these Usually for my 118 foot I order sneakers in size 125 D but due to previous reviews I purchased this shoes in 12 4E  now Im happy with this extraordinary pair of NB Perfette e comodissime Scarpe comodissime e arrivate molto prima del previsto Consiglio Sneakers molto belli I bought these sneakers for my 83 year old mom Were both preppys from the old days her the 5060s and me from the 80s Unfortunately the shoes were just too narrow for her foot and werent comfortable  Thus they were returned I on the other hand do not have a pair of red sneaks and Sperry fit my foot just fine I will purchase for myself with a five start review Cute but much narrower then my other pairs A este artÃ\\xadculo le doy 1010 me encantaron Son los clÃ¡sicos sperry Brand new a little tight first time wearing them but after about 3 wears fit just fine These shoes are super cute and comfortable I love them would buy again I really like these shoes Very classic look and extremely comfortable Great for my spring and summer look Didnâ\\x80\\x99t like fit or style I donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s a good quality Love the color and brand the sticking along the heel hurts The shoes are nice a bit snug though  But just break them in and you are good to go Buono Non confortevoli

prodotto e consegna veloce Light and airy Not supportive at all If you are on your feet for long hours buy arch support insoles before trying to wear these And wear socks that come higher than the cuff or you will be rubbed raw I recommend getting a half size bigger than you usually wear These were a gift for a friend who admired them while I was shopping The first pair were too big but returned them and Alex is thrilled with them They look really cool I donâ\\x80\\x99t think they will be ever out of style Sheâ\\x80\\x99s talking about buying another pair The price is very reasonable for the great quality  You should try a pair I got these usually have no problem with puma shoes but these are a  little on a small side ordered a 9 but feels like a 85 I have blister under my ankle

and she loved it So comfortable and nice Ich habe zwei Jacken bestellt in Farben Limette und GrÃ¼n Die Farbe Limette ist wie abgebildet Dies ist Geschmackssache Was ich aber zu bemÃ¤ngeln habe ist der Schnitt und vor allem die schlechte QualitÃ¤t des Stoffes Ich habe die gleiche Jacke in grÃ¼n die ich schon vor ca 4 Jahren in einem Store gekauft habe Die ist mir Superbegleitung beim Regenwetter gewesen nur ist sie etwas in die Jahre gekommen Daher habe ich mir Ã¼berlegt noch eine zu kaufen war aber sehr enttÃ¤uscht Die grÃ¼ne Farbe ist etwas abgewandelt aber das ist nicht sehr dramatisch Nur die alte Jacke war aus einem sehr angenehmen und weichen wasserabweisenden Stoff Die Jacken die ich hier bestellt habe sind hart und daher stehen sie ab und schmiegen nicht an KÃ¶rper Ausserdem wurde offensichtlich der  Schnitt geÃ¤ndert Die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 36 sitzt jetzt anders enger unbequemer auch des Stoffes wegen und im Brustbereich extrem eng AuÃ\\x9ferdem fehlen an der Jacke unter den Achseln zwei Ã\\x96ffnungen zur DurchlÃ¼ftung Sehr schade Die Jacken gehen sofort zurÃ¼ck Die angegebenen MaÃ\\x9fe stimmen leider Ã¼berhaupt nicht Habe statt 4850 schon 56 bestellt Und mehr geht leider nichtLt eigener BMSGrÃ¶Ã\\x9fentabelle im Umfang 140 cmNachgemessen leider nur knapp130 cm 10cm  wenigerKlingt gut wenn man sagt wie liefern bis 56Aber genaugenommen ist es nur eine ganz knappe 4850Schade das man da nicht genauer arbeitet oder zumindest die Angaben richtig machtUndOekoTexSiegel und dann kein Baumwollinnenfutterwie fast alle Mitbewerber sondern NylonSchadewar zwar die teuerste aber trotzdem mein Favoritbei meiner JackenauswahlAnmerkung 2 Flyer plus 2 A4 Hochglanz4Farbdruck ProduktblÃ¤tter plus 1 A4 HochglanzOekoCertifikate plus 1 A4 UmweltinfoBlatt  plus ein 42seitiger Katalogin welchem die kompletten Infos der losen BlÃ¤tter bereits sowieso enthalten sind relativieren fÃ¼r mich ein eigentlich lobenswertes Engagement fÃ¼r UmweltschutzVÃ¶llig Ã\\x9cberflÃ¼ssig  ZunÃ¤chst das Positive Das Material fasst sich sehr gut an riecht nicht und hat keinerlei Knitterfalten nach dem Transport Die Farbe ist ein sattes Melonenrot wirklich schÃ¶n Habe 2 Nummern grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt und die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt perfekt Sie ist hinten lÃ¤nger und sieht wirklich gut aus Sie hat tiefe Taschen in die allerhand reinpasst Als  Regenjacke kann ich sie aber Ã¼berhaupt nicht empfehlen Ich war 10 Min bei leichtem Regen unterwegs und komplett nass an den Unterarmen und vor allem an den Schultern Jeder Windzug geht durch Der Futterstoff innen ist glatt und kÃ¼hl Das ist unangenehm vor allem in den Taschen Nach dem Tragen braucht die Jacke ewig zum Trocknen Ich habe Regenjacken fÃ¼r 13 des Preises die funktionieren Dies war ein Fehlkauf und ist einfach nur eine Ã¼bermÃ¤Ã\\x9fig teure rote Jacke Schade Die Jacke ist echt hÃ¼bsch  Weil Leute schrieben man soll sie grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellen hab ich schon befÃ¼rchtet dass meine normale GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe zu klein sein wÃ¼rde und habe gleich 2 Jacken in Gr 52 und 54 bestellt  Normalerweise trage ich eine 4648 Ich hatte den Plan einen dicken Wollpulli drunter zu ziehen  Aber die 52  also 2 Nummern grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer   ist einfach zu eng Die 54 passt aber mit Pulli wÃ¤re es zu eng Habe beide zurÃ¼ck geschickt und jetzt eine 56 bestelltAn sich eine wunderschÃ¶ne Jacke die gut verarbeitet ist  Das Material ist etwas steif Die Farbe und Verarbeitung sind top Aber die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fenangabe stimmt einfach nichtEine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bedeutet dann aber auch dass die Ã\\x84rmel entsprechend lÃ¤nger sind  Was sich auf dem Rad dann allerdings auszahlt  Aber die Schultern sind halt auch breiter  Aber mir gefÃ¤llt die Jacke trotz dieser grÃ¶ssentechnischen MÃ¤ngel sehr und ich freue mich auf die Lieferung der grÃ¶Ã\\x9feren Jacke Das Ding ist schon ein Hingucker mit den PÃ¼nktchen Kaufe nur noch BMS Gummistiefel weil mich die QualitÃ¤t einfach Ã¼berzeugt Die sind zwar nicht gerade gÃ¼nstig aber jeden Cent wert wie ich finde Sie sind elastisch bleiben auch an kÃ¼hleren Tagen weich haben einen relativ kurzen und weiten Schaft so dass Hosen locker reinpassen und auch krÃ¤ftigere Beine gut Platz haben und sich die Kinder super darin bewegen kÃ¶nnen Die Sohle ist schÃ¶n flexibel und SchweiÃ\\x9ffÃ¼Ã\\x9fe gibt es auch nicht von innen mit ganz dÃ¼nnem Baumwollgewebe ausgekleidet Absolut wasserdicht tolle Farben guter Sitz Dadurch dass die Gummistiefel so flexibel sind Sohle und auch Schaft und nicht so hoch kÃ¶nnen die Kinder super darin laufen und trampeln nicht durch die Gegend Leicht an und auszuziehen Wir sind sehr enttÃ¤uscht Die Stiefel 2x angehabt 2x nasse FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe bekommen Als Mutter eines kleinen Kindes bin ich sehr enttÃ¤uscht schlieÃ\\x9flich kauft man Gummistiefel damit die KinderfÃ¼sse trocken bleiben und nicht umgekehrt  Es reicht aus wenn es drauÃ\\x9fen etwas frischer ist bei nassen FÃ¼ssen ist eine ErkÃ¤ltung vorprogrammiert In der CoronaZeit sehr erfreulich  Wenn man die Stiefeln betrachtet findet man keinen Mangel Der wird bei der BerÃ¼hrung der Stiefel mit dem Wasser gezeigt Es war nicht einfach die Kontaktdaten des VerkÃ¤ufers zu finden Ich wÃ¼rde am liebsten 0 Sterne gebenUpdate Der VerkÃ¤ufer ist Toj Skandinavian Kids Fashion vertrieben durch KKTrade GmbH Offensichtlich werden Ã¼ber dieses Angebot Stiefeln verschiener VerkÃ¤ufer vertrieben Nach den vorherigen Bewertungen habe ich den Mantel 34 GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellt und das war wirklich gut soSo sitzt er perfekt und ich kann noch dicke Pullover darunter tragen Die Kapuze ist etwas klein vor allem wenn man eine MÃ¼tze darunter trÃ¤gtDafÃ¼r habe ich mir aber schon seit lÃ¤ngerem einen wasserdichten SÃ¼dwester zugelegt Der Mantel und Regenhut  sind eine unschlagbare KombiDen Mantel konnte ich auf mehreren mehrstÃ¼ndigen Regentouren auf seine Wasserdichte testen und bin vollstens zufrieden da nicht ein Tropfen durch kamDer Mantel wirkt sehr wertig und schÃ¶n verarbeitet Sonst habe ich in wasserdichten Regenjacken das GefÃ¼hl in einer PlastetÃ¼te zu stecken aber das ist hier nicht der Fall Ich suche fÃ¼r unsere Kinde stets Schuhe die dem FuÃ\\x9f viel Freiraum bieten minimal oder auch Barfusschuhe sind mir am liebsten Diese Stiefel sind sehr leicht und wirklich fÃ¼r Gummistifel sehr flexibel hÃ¤ngen nicht wie ein Klotz am Bein Was mich sehr stÃ¶rt ist das oben kein Stoff ist mit Kordel zum zu ziehen damit kein wasserDreck in die Schuhe kommt Das passiert bei meiner Tochter immer wieder und nervt sie Da man das aber ja auch auf dem Foto sieht ziehe ich dafÃ¼r keinen Stern ab eben gekauft wie gesehen  Die Stiefel riechen absolut gar nicht nach Chemie das ist klasse Allerdings fressen sich Erdspuren in die Farbe des Stiefels ein Ã¤hnlich wie bei Kleidung das finde ich bei Gummistifeln weniger schlimm da sie ja eh nicht zum schick sein gedacht sind  Super verarbeitetSieht hochwertig ausIst komplett wasserdichtHÃ¤lt auch den Wind ab hÃ¤lt dadurch ziemlich warm Ich trage sie bis ca 7 grad mit einer fleecejacke darunter und das ist vollkommen in OrdnungSie ist seit dem Kauf in stÃ¤ndigem Gebrauch ich kann dir weiter empfehlenGrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 38 bestellt weicht von der 36 nicht allzu viel ab Sie passt wer es gern etwas weiter mag nimmt lieber eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer Ich habe mich entschieden diese Gummistiefel fÃ¼r mein Kind zu kaufen um die giftigen Inhaltsstoffe anderer Marken zu meiden Wenn man daran glaubt verdient ein Gummistiefel ohne gesundheitsgefÃ¤hrdende Stoffe natÃ¼rlich einen Bonusstern Farbe Funktion und Bequemlichkeit sind ebenfalls super Deutliche AbzÃ¼ge gibts von mir wegen der Haltbarkeit Nach 18 Monaten hat ein Schuh einen langen wasserdurchlÃ¤ssigen Riss ohne dass die Schuhe mit etwas anderem als Sandkastensand und Plastikspielzeug in Kontakt gekommen wÃ¤ren FÃ¼r diejenigen die darauf spekulieren dÃ¼rfen dass das Kind nach 18 Monaten eh eine neue SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe brauch kann ich eine Kaufempfehlung geben FÃ¼r alle anderen eher nicht Normally I fit 85 true to size but this time Id try to half size up because these would be my beaters and Im 17 still growing and when I got them they feel fit like an 85 Still satisfied with what came in looks amazing just a little size problem If youre gonna go true to size go half up  The way the materials are put together inside shoe its very uncomfortable not smooth Cuts left foot where foot and toes come together If Id tried them on in a store I would have been able to feel it and not purchase Not like the others Ive bought before like these that I really liked Wont buy another pair Will look for another brand probably in a store where I can try on Disappointing since Ive really loved this brand and style before Bought these as a gift for my fiancee because heoves this brand and shoe style He loves them He opened the box and was so happy They fit perfect and as expected  Must buy If you checking them out dont hesitate BUY  Ive worn Reebok Classics size 75 for decades Oddly for the past 18 months my feet have been growing and Ive changed to size 8 then 85 and now size 9 Still happy with the shoes These shoes are great They are very comfortable for walking And a perfect fitsize Had the shoes a long time ago do you still feel great I have bought this model 5 times and now quality very disappointed The nose of the sneaker came off after couple wearing Cant contact with customer service and solve this problem Es perfecto como la descripciÃ³n Leather item not fake I pretty much like just everything about them  Will be a little bit better when they stretch some On their way back  Ive always worn these and this pair was much narrower than I remember I question authenticity DiseÃ±o antiguo y calidad regular para el precio que tienen No me han gustado nada son mÃ¡s feas y simples en mano que en la foto No las recomiendo Eso sÃ\\xad el tamaÃ±o habitual encaja perfectamente Icvh habe schon einige Schuhe von Andrea Conti und war immer sehr zufrieden Dieser Sneaker hat aber einen ganz anderen Schnitt er ist vorne so eng da man Ã¼berhaupt nicht hineinkommt AuÃ\\x9ferdem fÃ¤llt er viel kleiner aus Article encore plus jolie quen photo chaussure au top Fatal Pague enviÃ³ rÃ¡pido 3 dÃ\\xadas y me tardo casi un mesPor otro lado el producto bien original y todo eso The sneakers smelled like plasticsynthetic not like authentic leather I love Dolce Vita shoes and sneaks These are no exception However I did have to exchange for a 12 size smaller from 65 to a 6 Not sure if my feet shrunk or these run a little big Im usually a true 65 in DV footwear  Great style with the slight platform and I love the canvas and snake print mix media I love how comfortable they are and so cute I think they run a little big but since they lace up itâ\\x80\\x99s not that big of a deal I thought they were tieless laces but they are not Good Cute style and very comfortable SchÃ¶ne warme Stiefel fÃ¼r Arbeiten im Freien Ich habe ein paar Flip Flops fÃ¼rs schwimmen meiner Tochter gesucht die ihr gefallen und wo der Preis stimmt Die Lieferung kam wie versprochen und sie sehen auch wie auf dem Bild auf Meine Tochter hat die 33 und ich habe sie in 3334 bestellt Passen super und hat auch noch etwas platz Denke eine Nummer GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fer wÃ¤re dann zu groÃ\\x9f Sie stinken nicht also super Ich wÃ¼rde sie wieder kaufen und meine Tochter ist happy Muy bonitas flexibles y cÃ³modas Son las mejores las mÃ¡s duraderas Yo he repetido compra para mi hija por eso porque ella estropea mucho los zapatos normalmente pero estas se la han quedado pequeÃ±as  y estÃ¡n nuevas y eso que tambiÃ©n las usa para piscina todo el aÃ±o Recomiendo pedir un nÃºmero mÃ¡s pq dan poca talla El precio por 13â\\x82¬ genial Das Material ist etwas fester als bei anderen FlipFlops daher sind sie wie bei uns genutzt als Badeschuhe perfekt geeignet da sie kein Wasser aufsaugen FÃ¼r lÃ¤ngeres Tragen sicher nicht so optimal weil man dadurch eher schwitzt Ich liebe die Ipanemas und meine MÃ¤dchen auch Sie tragen sie seit GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 22 Allerdings weise ich hier daraufhin dass meine jetzt 5jÃ¤hrige Tochter die deutsche GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 2728 trÃ¤gt

wieder kaufen Farbe wie abgebildet leider rollt sich die Schuheinlage beim gehen zusammen da sie nur eingelegt ist Sehr bequeme Schuhe Alles super  vielen Dank  gerne wieder La scarpa Ã¨ bella leggera cool ma purtroppo la taglia Ã¨ davvero INDICATIVA I 25 cm segnati sulletichetta sono in realtÃ\\xa0 26 e oltre Occhio alla misura se las compre a mi hija y dice que son muy comodas y muy bonitas Muy mala calidad puestas 2 veces y ya estan como viejas These shoes are cool in that if your kid is crappy at tying shoes the shoes stay on whether or not they are tiedI was afraid the fit was going to be too snug but he was able to pull them on easily   Im going to preface my criticism with this my son is hard on his shoes he runs in his runners club about a 15 miles a day and then plays hard the rest of the timesothe laces didnt last two weeks after about two months these are looking a bit worn and frayed on the upper near the toe really its cosmeticThe sole is holding true its not pulling way or peeling like cheaper shoes do the tread looks good  there is a lot of wear in the midfoot on the insert of the shoe so I am curious how long until the midfoot  cushioning starts to break down so far so good they just look beat When I saw these sneakers I had to get them because I love the way they looked but it fit my son feet some what small which Im not thrilled about that because on the website said it runs true to size I did not want to even bother sending it back so I just gave it to my nephew These shoes looks super cute online but the toe part is long and makes them look weird on my sons feet But the bigger draw back is that on the inside of the heel is the bubble like cushion that sticks out like a 12 inch He said it was very uncomfortable and rubbed on him Cute and fun Definitely not a shoe to run in but good enough to throw on for errands Fit a little big but was expecting that My son has two pairs of these shoes He loves them and he wears them all the time We have taken them to Disney and Universal multiple times and he says they are extremely comfy Unfortunately these shoes runs very big I really liked the color and material but their is no support on your feet when you walkrun or while doing any kind of sport My only complaint is that the tongue is attached to the sides of the shoe and cant be pulled up to make it easier to put the shoe on  Other than that and I understand that is becoming a common feature in athletic shoes I like them just fine Habe mir den Schuh zum kleinen Preis bestellt wirklich prima ist das neue Futter Megaweich sogar die Sohle Allerdings sollte man fÃ¼r diesen Schuh keine zu breiten FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe haben Ich selbst habe schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe und mir passt er prima Die Farbe braun stimmt so nicht ist eher olivgrÃ¼n GefÃ¤llt mir aber recht gut Absolute Weierempfehlung von mir Belli leggeri e morbidi all interno Calzano un po piccoli Consiglio numero piÃ¹ grande Presi in saldo sodisfatta Sehr schÃ¶ner und gut verarbeiteter Araschuh Material weich und angenehme Luftpolstersohle Klasse Farbe wirkt sportlich Leider war der Schuh trotz richtig bestellter GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe zu klein musste zurÃ¼ck geschickt werden Schade No es la talla correcta Indica 425 y en la caja de indica 405 Una pena Tutto okay Gute QualitÃ¤t GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passt angenehm zu tragen Rot entspricht dem auf dem Foto in Summe wirkt der Schuh jedoch am FuÃ\\x9f etwas Ã¤ltlich FidÃ¨les aux photos belle qualitÃ© La semelle est amovible et vous pouvez donc mettre la votre si nÃ©cessaireConfortable mÃªme pour pieds larges Super bequem Sehr gute QualitÃ¤t Sehr schÃ¶ner Schuh Nachdem ich inzwischen bereits diverse Turnschuhe der Marke Nike bestellt und anprobiert habe muss ich sagen dass es mich nicht wundert dass die hier vorliegenden Nike FS Lite Run 2 Damen Laufschuhe auch nicht passen denn anscheinend hat sich die generelle Unsitte der zu kleinen Turnschuhe eingebÃ¼rgert was sehr Ã¤rgerlich ist ich meine wenn man als Frau schon GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 43  bestellen muss obwohl man normalerweise 2 SchuhgrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen kleiner trÃ¤gt und die dann auch nicht passen ich hÃ¤tte wahrscheinlich 44 oder 45 gebraucht das ist schon mehr als grenzwertig normal ist fÃ¼r meine Begriffe anders Ich frage mich warum die Turnschuhhersteller an ihren Kunden vorbei produzieren das kann es doch nicht sein Aber bei den anderen groÃ\\x9fen Sportschuhanbietern ist es das gleiche Trauerspiel Dabei sind gerade in dieser und der letzten Saison die Modelle so farbenfroh wie nie und man wÃ¼rde gerne sogar mehrere Paare kaufen aber sie mÃ¼ssten natÃ¼rlich passen das tun sie aber nicht Entweder drÃ¼cken sie vorne von oben auf den groÃ\\x9fen Zeh herunter was schmerzt oder sie sind zu kurz und drÃ¼cken schmerzen ebenfalls oder sie sind insgesamt am Spann viel zu niedrig so dass man bei geschnÃ¼rtem Schuh immer noch eine super breite SchnÃ¼rlasche hat von weitem sieht das dann aus als hÃ¤tte man ElefantenfÃ¼Ã\\x9fe weil die Schuhe zu wenig Material haben um ganz geschlossen zu werden und das bei mir die ich superschlanke FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe habe und jahrelang Ballett getanzt habe einfach skandalÃ¶s ME sollten die Nike Leute ihren Produzenten mal neue Schuhformen spendieren die hier scheinen noch aus einem anderen Kulturkreis zu stammen in dem man PuppenfÃ¼Ã\\x9fchen hat aber nicht die FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe einer groÃ\\x9fen westeuropÃ¤ischen Frau Dieser Schuh ist ein Traum fÃ¼r groÃ\\x9fe und etwas breitere keine zierlichen DamenfÃ¼Ã\\x9fe die ein paar Kilos mehr tragen mÃ¼ssenSuper bequem trage sie den ganzen Tag bei der Arbeit in der Freizeit zum Nordic Walking auf lÃ¤ngeren AusflÃ¼gen zum ShoppenHab sie mir in drei verschiedenen Farbvarianten geholt FÃ¼r die Farbkombi habe ich schon viele Komplimente bekommen Toll fÃ¼r den Sommer Ich habe den Schuhe bereits in zwei Farben weil er einfach gut sitzt und dabei auch noch sehr schÃ¶n ist Ich trage die Schuhe sowohl als Sportschuh und als Alltagsschuh Ein super schÃ¶ner und bequemer Schuh den ich mir immer wieder kaufen wÃ¼rde Sieht super das passt perfekt und meine Tochter ist glÃ¼cklich Sie hat Gr35 und der Schuh 355 passt sehr gut Das LaufgefÃ¼hl ist auch sehr gut Der Schuh ist super bequem und sieht auch gut ausAllerdings habe ich eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestelltIch habe eigentlich 39 und habe jetzt 40 genommen und er passt super Okk Ganz tolle Nike SchuheGrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe passte wie immer perfekt geniale Farben und einfach ein Traum was den Tragekomfort angehtWÃ¼rde sie mir auf jeden Fall wieder kaufen  Super toller Schuh Passt super Sehr schÃ¶ne QualitÃ¤t Sehr bequem zu tragen Man lÃ¤uft wie auf Wolken Nur zu empfehlen good condition its nice and comfortable They are equal parts too big and too small The proportions of these shoes are so off that the strap on the left was tight while the one on the right was super loose They are pretty comfortable the middle piece between my toes kind of hurt but nothing the I wouldnt get used to Over all these shoes are ok someone will love them they just arent for me These suck I loved the look so I ordered a pair Loved them and hadnâ\\x80\\x99t had them long at all then they came unstitched by the elastic I thought maybe I did something wrong so I ordered another pair and everything was going great and it just happened again yesterday Not only am I so so disappointed bc they are apparently not good quality but these were the cutest and went with everything It makes me mad because I loved them so much They are well made but the finger separator is too sturdy It hurts so much I cant wear them even if I put bandages all over my fingers I get a lot of blisters It is impossible to loosen this thing up especially during hot summers when the feet swell At this point they can only be a house decoration For the price these shoes are great  I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly  The straps feel extremely sturdy and they are pretty comfortable for being a flat shoe with little support  The only complaint I have is that the bottoms of them is pretty slick I ordered a size 11 and the shoe itself fit perfectly But the strap with the buckle was way to short to go around my ankle HOWEVER the straps were so soft and the shoes so comfortable I still recommend them Just for people with smaller feet I have never had a problem wearing anklets They were a bit tight in the toe areabut they were cute and didnâ\\x80\\x99t give me any blisters wearing them throughout the day I was able to take them to the water as well and it didnâ\\x80\\x99t damage the sole I was not feeling the color but I bought anyway I run between a 65 and a 7 size I ordered a 7 and they were way too small I could have easily gotten an 8 I just gave them to my daughter instead of returning The footbed has minimal cushioning but enough to keep your foot from sliding around  The toe separator could be more comfortable  They seem well made enough  Theyre cute  Theyre 10  The sizing runs maybe a tiny bit small  I usually wear an 11 in a shoe and I often can get away with a 10 in sandals  I got the 11 and was glad that I did  The 10 would have been way too small These are a steal If you hate stiff flat sandals then this is your answer Super soft straps thin but cushioned sole My feet are very widethick and these are just perfect sandals for me Wish they came in more colors Itâ\\x80\\x99s not black Itâ\\x80\\x99s dark blue It first came a size ten The bag said 7 but clearly it was a size 10 I would give it a worse rating for that part but itâ\\x80\\x99s actually a cute sandal I prefer the navy blue and itâ\\x80\\x99s comfortable so I canâ\\x80\\x99t rate it lower I like what I got and itâ\\x80\\x99s great quality Passt perfekt fÃ¼r mein Sohn cette paire plait Ã©normÃ©ment Ã\\xa0 mon garÃ§on de 10 ans et pourtant cest compliquÃ© de lui trouver des baskets qui lui plaisent Never ordered shoes online as I like to fit them first  I have had asics in the past so I hoped they be the same as in the past as far as fit  They fit great and are comfortable  I am a smaller adult so my 55 size shoes are hard to find in stores unless I go to young boys shoes and the selection there isnt the greatest for adult colors  I like them My daughter absolutely loves them She had the black pair for last season and outgrew them so she got the white ones and they fit perfect and looked sharp with her uniform Excellent starter pair for my kid to wear for their first volleyball season So happy with my purchase I needed to buy slip ons after my shoulder surgery and these are the best Great shoe for price These shoes are absolutely fabulous They are lightweight and have great support and they are very comfortable I just absolutely love them The shoe is super comfortable and lightweight for walkingThe eyelets for the shoelace are very thin and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure they are going to last if you try and tighten up the laces with repeated use and only time will tell I purchased the navy blue ones and they have normal eyelets Wear these no socks  Massage therapist Want more black my size 41womenâ\\x80\\x99s 10 and some water proofWith Essentrics exercise these are the best thing for balance for my work and even walking the dogs I needed a second pair of sneakers for work  soooo happy I bought these very comfy Le he comprado estas Playeras  a mi hijo que usa el 40 e igual le quedan un pelin grandes pero un casi nada son

llego 3 These shoes were very nice but I ordered a half size larger as recommended by most of the reviews and they were definitely too big I would say order your usual size I did feel like the shoes had a bit of a forward tilt which is maybe helpful for some avid runners It felt unfamiliar to me so I did not reorder in my correct size However very stylish and appeared to be of good quality Fit me well I got a size 10 wide and they are comfy with plenty of room in the toe box Its too cold to hike right now though so Ill have to wait to get a true assessment But walking on city streets is comfortable with no pinch point or tight spots No he encontrado ni una sola review de Ã©stas botas ni siquiera existen para el fabricante aunque el vendedor las describe como aptas para practicar el trail running No se deberÃ\\xada practicar ningÃºn tipo de ejercicio con ellas son inestables y el drop es demasiado alto Perfectas para pasear aunque cuidado en verano el piÃ© puede alcanzar la temperatura del sol No las recomiendo en absoluto he tenido que pagar gastos de envio para recibirlas ya que confiÃ© en la descripciÃ³n y es totalmente errÃ³nea Ahora a pagar tambiÃ©n para devolverlas Tardaron tres semanas y ademÃ¡s el transportista se negÃ³ a subirlas a casa porque estaba muy alto Toda una odisea No compro mÃ¡s zapatillas en Amazon mientras permitan la venta de Ã©stos productos sin control de calidad en este caso de falsedad Una vergÃ¼enza EstÃ¡n muy bonitos pero me mandaron la talla equivocada se me hace injusto que esto pase en todos los pedidos ya que la mayorÃ\\xada de

shoes ever Made for all terrain is correct  but more of a outdoor rough hike or shore walk along a rugged beachI tried  and struck out  worn and cant return If looking for comfort run run far away  use whatever is covering then toes not a bolt in the opposite direction Now Go I returned so many because the size was wrong but this one is good  perfect fit  I Order a 95 size and it fit with bigger

and cute Comodissime grazie alla misura L non facile da trovare in altre marchePiÃ¹ leggere dei modelli precedenti Tour 360Vedremo la tenuta nel tempo AchetÃ©e en pointure 48 Dommage quAdidas ne les propose pas en France Taille bien adaptÃ©e chaussure lÃ©gÃ¨re et confortable After a couple wears this becomes an extremely comfortable spikeless golf shoe They fit a little snug but relaxes after a while I wont wear these in wet soggy conditions because I dont feel the traction would hold up with mud caked on the bottom Ive played two rounds in semi dry ground and the shoes were perfect Only complaint  the tongue can be a bit stiff and can be annoying if not flattened out Other than that its a great stylish comfortable summer golf shoe These are by far the most comfortable golf shoes Ive ever owned and possibly the most comfortable shoes of any kind that I currently own The fit is perfect and I love that they are so lightweight I sometimes buy wide shoes because some designs are too narrow but I got the standard width and it is perfect I was unsure how I would like a spikeless design but stability and traction were great Combined with the amazing comfort I will never go back to spikes Once you try these neither will you Wow I just finished 18 holes today with my new Adidas S2g golf shoes and they get an A for comfort fit and water repellant  I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember the last time I put on a pair of shoes out of the box and felt completely comfortable wearing them  4 hours walking the course and they were great from start to finish  I hope this model is available when I need a new pair because these are worth a â\\x80\\x9cWill buy againâ\\x80\\x9d rating Nice quality shoe but I have a couple problems with it that lead to a 2 start rather than 5  BOA is using string instead of wire which it normally does and youâ\\x80\\x99re not able to get a proper tight fit Second biggest issue is the fabric of the shoe lens it self to bunching up when you try to tighten it One of the biggest issues is the tongue of the shoe is too puffy so when the BOA strings is trying to tighten it has to fight the puffiness which lends to a loose fit  Folks who love and use BOA on their shoes will understand Last major issue which is the shoe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough arch support atleast IMHO On the plus side the sole of the shoe is one of the nicest Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen but at this point Iâ\\x80\\x99ll probably stick with Puma or FootJoy Needed to replace my spikeless Nikes that had no grip left Nike Roche G so not much spikiness on the bottom to begin withPlayed my first 18 with these today They did the job pretty well They were a little stiff at first but broke in and softened up in no time at all I love the new BOA style tying mechanism Its fun to just pull the knob up and flop your shoes off They have great grip on the bottom I felt very stable in my swingsId like them to have maybe just a little bit more cushioning Nikes had a lot of suishy bounce in them Dont get me wrong theyre definitely comfy Nice and roomy Played a full round and had zero comfort issuesOverall really happy with these Bought these because my Nikes while really nice make my feet ridiculously hot in the Florida weather These shoes are definitely not for wet weather but man are they comfortable They seem like they will breathe really well but only time will tell I am very happy with the fit Iâ\\x80\\x99m a 125 in all adidas shoes so I knew what size to order and they fit perfectly Tried four different golf shoes 200 range  for the other named brand shoes  This golf shoe won hands down on comfort stability and fit  Also outstanding waterproofing that proved itself beyond my expectations  Very much worth the money and style is great as well  Great shoe to double for street walking This is my third pair of Adidas golf shoes I have bought in the past six months  I play year round walk and carry my bag so fit and comfort is critical  First two pairs are great so I expected the same with this pair  Received them on Sunday and played in them on Tuesday  After 12 holes my feet felt as if I was playing in leather soled dress shoes  My heels are very low in the shoe and the ball of the feet feel bruised  The support and comfort is completely different from my first two pairs of Adidas  I will need to add inserts to play in these again  Same price as the first two but comfort is not comparable Absolutely comfortable right out of the box Have been looking for comfortable sneakers that are not clunky and heavy like reebockwhich I had been wearing These are stylish and sooooo comfortable and not heavy like walking on air  Winner for sure Five stars for sureThis is my second pair of Propet and I think Im in love just wore these for the first timeto an amusement park  After thousands of steps my feet still felt like thy did when I left the houseThey are my new go to  I use my other pair for exercise walking its like walking on a cloud and guess whatIm up to almost 3 miles but always do at least 1 12 to 2 each time out and my shoes are NEVER A PROBLEMI like Skechers as well but these offer a unique kind of sturdiness and support thats very different Wore these shoes for first time amd really like them Very light weight and they are a bit large because I ordered them half a size larger so I could wear thicker socks Worked out fine I ordered these in XXwide and the toe box is not very wide They are more wide in the middle of the shoe These must be intended for swollen feetankles not wide feet I have problems with my feet swelling inconsistently from normal to 4E from day to day  I purchased the 4E to fit the fattest my feet get but when the swelling is less they fit too  The tongue of the shoe is not attached to the sides of the shoe so gives you more space and with the laces I can tighten the shoe to fit my foot  I love these so much that I bought 3 colors so I have variety  They are comfortable to walk in and give good support The shoe was in the wrong box  It was too small  To return it I had to take it to the USPS store which I could not get to  So I have a pair of shoes for the trash  Last time I buy shoes from amazon I have wide feet especially in the toes area  I have a devil of a time finding shoes that dont cramp my toes  Well these did the trick for me  They are good looking and comfortable  Thank you thank you thank you Lightweight but substantial Fits well but for a double extra wide Ive had wider shoes Love the Prime Wardrobe trybefore youbuy option Ensures you get what youre looking for Im in Love with these shoesIve been having lower back pain the last couple of monthsI have bought several different types of walking shoes Asics Schetchers and tried On Cloud these are more comfortable I nnormally wear a 95 or 10 I decided to order 95  xwide Ive never worn an xwide but i like the extra room i got with theseThey fit perfect with plenty of roomI was worried they would old lady like lol But i really like the lookAnd iâ\\x80\\x99m even wanting to walk for exercise nowHighly recommend Width good at 6XX but toe box hurts my little toe Disappointed I had to return Mooie sneakers maar ze is jets te groot The back material is already ripped on both sandals  They look like they are last years shoes My son always complains that shoes arenâ\\x80\\x99t comfortable but he loves these and wears them every day Great shoe that is also cool I bought these for my son for Christmas along with another pair that he liked more  He has only worn these 3 times and it is already tearing at the toe tab  Love the look and the feel  Knit shoe is real comfy  The ortho sockliner is great  Overall lots of cushion  Not really the most athletic shoe but great daily wear Fit good came with no box But brand new My husband loves the style the way the sneakers fit and the color burgundy is so prettyI definitely recommend this shoe Love them Feel great on Distinguishably casual Great sneakers comfortable feels half size larger I purchased a pair of these shoes for my 6 yr old son to wear to school They arrived on time Put them on him this morning to go to school and these are some sharp snazzy looking tennis shoes They looked awesome on him They fit just as expectedâ\\x80¦ But if you are in between sizes go with the larger size AlwaysIf I had one complaint about these shoesâ\\x80¦ It would be on the top band where it says Afidas real bigâ\\x80¦ That part is semi snug on the kids foot But after all they are brand new and never been worn so maybe they just need a little time to get broken in someOther than that killer sharp little shoe My son HAD to have these The sole is cheap foamand the traction has completely worn off The bottoms are completely smooth now They have no laces so now theyve  stretched out so bad they come off very easily I would not recommend I love Addidas but for the price  these are a fail  Got for my 8 year old Love them Theyâ\\x80\\x99re comfortable and easy to put on  And stylish for my 4thgrade boy These shoes seem well made and the length seems true to size However the band across the foot is extremely snug and my child had trouble getting his foot into the shoe himself When he did get his foot in the shoe was quite narrow and pinched his toes on the sides of the toe box despite having plenty of length He usually wears regular width shoes but these were too narrow for him Second pair to own because they are comfortable Easy to slide on I  wear a womens size  6 I bought a kids 4 12 and it fits perfict They fit well and are comfortable My only complaint is that they arenâ\\x80\\x99t as breathable as I would of liked My boys love these shoes itâ\\x80\\x99s all they will wear They tear up fast if you have rough boys but you should expect that from anything with rough boys ð\\x9f¤·ð\\x9f\\x8f¼â\\x80\\x8dâ\\x99\\x80ï¸\\x8fð\\x9f¤ª Poor quality tip of sneaker ripping apart  not durable at all after only a month Bought for my 6 years old 1st grade girl My other kids sneakers didnt do this all at Very soft sole My 7 year old wore the sole out in less than 2 months My son loves them he thinks he can run faster with these on They fit great  seem durable and comfortable Look great too Great shoes my son love it Comodidad Great shoe arrived quite late but product is good Bought these for my daughter who absolutely loves them She is a picky person when it comes to shoes because she has a wide foot which can be hard to find a good looking great fitting shoe They are perfect for her and she said she never wants to take them off so in all I  am glad I bought them Quality These do not seem like authentic adidas They have a very strange look in person I do not like them at all and nor does my childFit I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend ordering these but if you do make sure your kiddo has a narrow foot and order a half size up at least My daughter really likes these shoes and does everything in them Its just unfortunate that the shiny stripes started peeling off within the first week of wear Now 3 are peeling off and flapping around and it just looks really sloppy as though shes been wearing them for a couple years instead of a couple months My mom got so concerned seeing the state of her shoes a couple weeks ago that shes ordering her another pair ð\\x9f¤£ But other than making me look like a negligent mom theyre comfortable and lightweight and cute Great looking shoe  I love the look of these on my son  As boys do though he is pretty rough on clothes and shoes  The fabric that covers the top of the toes looks like of like mesh got a couple of small holes in it after a couple of months and now after 34 months of wearing them the entire piece of fabric on the top of the shoe is basically flapping in the breeze its pulled back so far  The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok so I guess more of a cosmetic issue but still annoying  Not sure Id buy these again simply because of that but I did love them for the first couple of months I thought adidas would offer a quality material but my 6 year old son already was able to wear it out the tip of the shoes within two months All he has been doing with the shoes is walking running biking  playing in recess outside in school He does not play soccer so kicking or something like that is not the reason why the fronts torn out Looked great to start but after a few short weeks the front plastic toe started to crack open Typical daily use Would not recommend this product The sandals were very cute extremely undersized My granddaughter wears a size 3 and these wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even go on her foot She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have a wide foot so they should have at least went on width wise To me they looked more like a size 1 I returned them I had bought them for a trip and there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t enough time to reorder Very narrow at the toes The beading was already curling up when we received it Poorly sewn Very low quality materials Had to return themRight away When I saw the shoes I liked them because they would match a dress I bought for my daughter and I to have our family photos done When the shoes arrived I was immediately disappointed at how the shoe felt over all When I went to try them on my daughter she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even slide her feet in because the straps at the front were too tight I even put lotion on her feet to see if they would slide in easier and thought she just needed to break them in My daughter started crying after having them on for less than 5 minutes Her feet had the strap marks imprinted on the tops of her feet for about 30 minutes My daughter is very petite and has little feet We ordered the sandals and they are super cute but the straps that go over the foot are ridiculously small My daughterâ\\x80\\x99s foot wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t fit We exchanged for a larger sizeâ\\x80\\x94 the same problem We have never run into this issue before with any shoes or sandals Disappointed as they are so adorable Super cute shoes my granddaughter is wearing with her summer dress to a wedding My daughter bought several sizes because we believed the reviews just by your normal size They are very pretty and stylish  however I had to get them a size bigger because the front of her foot would not go in properly These LOOK cute but the quality is terrible One of the straps broke after a month3 days after the return window My 5yr old is so disappointed ð\\x9f\\x98\\x9e  dont waste your money or time on these As far as the shoe size goes it is true to size but the strap over the toes is too tight My child is pretty slim and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have fat feet so I think the toe strap area could be a bit bigger These were really cute However they are too narrow so I had to return My daughter loves them  Super sparkly and cute QualitÃ¤t ist gut roch etwas streng nach Gummi haben ihn 1 Tag ausgelÃ¼ftet vorm tragendann wÃ¤rs gut Guter Tragekomfort sagt mein

BuenÃ\\xadsima calidad y son preciosas la talla es la que se usa habitual SuperschÃ¶n Toll ausgefallen Schnelle Lieferung Jederzeit wieder El diseÃ±o muy buenos pero las tallas confusas para mexico These are nice looking and feel solid however my right boot came with a 1 long defect on the right side near the toe stitching that appears to have had an attempt to be fixed Ill be returning these unfortunatelyUPDATE 12022018  After some thinking and looking around for other black boots I decided to give this pair another shot  After all I liked their look and design and figured I should give them another try  My new pair came basically free of any defects to the leather  However the white stitching around the toe area wasnt quite as clean and neatly done as I would expect from Ariat  I know these are only 150 but still this kind of issue should be easily preventable  Other than that these boots are very comfortable and took very little time to breakin  Maybe a couple of days  And to get around the slippery leather sole I took them to a Cobbler who applied a thin rubber layer over the leather sole  It was a great fix that I had not previously heard of  I hate leather soles These boots are comfortable and last a long time Very well constructed Got as Christmas gift and got the same size as last pair He loved them Great boots The boots look great I accidentally ordered a EE in width but Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I did because they are still a little tight Okay  this may not be a name you are framiliar with I was not  But this is my second pair and finally I am not wearing out one side of my shoes and my feet no longer hurt  I got my first pair from the orthopedic shoe  soles and am not looking back Yes I recomend this product Typical of most men  I buy the same shoe over and over again The sole is different but cures my issues with pain in my Achilles I like the shoes very much and seem to be high quality Sizing is right on They are super comfortable and I feel like my posture is better when walking AchetÃ© en rose elles sont parfaites Comme sur la photoTaille bienMa fille est ravie Parfait ma fille fait 25 et je sais mettre un doigt derriÃ¨re son talon A couple of friends praised Hokaâ\\x80\\x99s and how comfortable they are so I decided to cough up the extra money for a pair since I have a bad knee They are ok tennis shoes but the thick sole seems more for looks then comfort so value for money is a bit disappointing Voleci Ottimo El envÃ\\xado tardÃ³ menos de lo esperado pero la caja venÃ\\xada en una bolsa y la caja estaba en un mal estado los tenis no me quedaron bien por tener el empeine alto Bought these to replace an old set  Not the best looking but they fit as expected and are well built turf boots Great cleat light weight  great on the field turfOnly downfall very difficult to get on because of the tight sock material on the ankle have to use a shoehorn to get them on  Know way I was fitting my foot through there  Overall very pleased with the product Tal y como lo esperaba It was good The good  shoe is light and flexible with enough padding in the heel so you donâ\\x80\\x99t bruise your heel when playing on really hard fields Length was true to size Fun colorThe bad  I stopped wearing them after five practices due to how hard they are to get on Takes forever to get my feet through the upper sock thatâ\\x80\\x99s attached to the shoe They made it too small without enough stretch Some type of neoprene would have been a better choice vs ribbed cotton The shoe itself is A bit narrow even for a medium width foot They werenâ\\x80\\x99t painfull  but they werenâ\\x80\\x99t comfortable either They arrived a day before a soccer tournament I had they feel extremely good the built in compression socks is really comfortable I used them in real grass with some patches and didnt have any issues with the traction and hold in on I also tend to slide a little bit the foot and when having to accelerate didnt have any problem After like 20 minutes of playing I start having blisters on my backheel I think I still have to break them in but meanwhile they look amazing they have really nice traction Im hoping they can break in quickly Great shoe for turf fields My only issue is that you must wear socks the come well over the ankle cuff and they have to be on the thicker side or the shoe will rub your achilles raw Otherwise the shoes offer good support and Im very pleased with them I normally am a size 1213 so I went with a 125  It is hard to buy shoes online without trying them on first so I gave it a go  I took them out for a game last night  They are very comfortable for turf however given the large size my touch was heavy and I couldnt connect with long passes getting under the ball  My lesson learned try the size before you buy Runs huge Returned three times for different sizes until the size was decent No support on footbed Not impressed Their market should stick to outdoors cleats of which Adidas is king Although the newer version of beloved outdoor clear Nemesis 193 is terrible on the ankle support Please go back to the 183 None of the travel soccer boys like the new version I wanted a nice tennis shoe for the fall and this fit the bill I love the colors and theyâ\\x80\\x99re comfortable too I listened to the other buyers and bought a smaller size to be safe I wear a 7 and bought it in a 65 and itâ\\x80\\x99s a good fit They run SO big I wear an 85 Ordered these shoes and they fit more like a 9 or 95 I recommend going at least one size downThese shoes are cute but they look very bulky on my feet Beautiful sneaker Very comfortable Runs a full size large I normally wear 9510 but found that a 9 was the best fit in this style Color is beautiful dusty rose Ya tenÃ\\xada unos en otro color pero con el cambio de uniforme necesite estos y como si los hubiera comprado en Adidas Iâ\\x80\\x99d been eyeing these are they are unbelievable Seller was awesome quick shipping  Get them They have great arch support and I love the color A bit tight on my right heal but long socks help relieve that I usually wear a 758 Based on other reviews I ordered a half size smaller and went with a 7 These fit pretty well however I think a 65 may have been too small I absolutely love love love these shoes I want a pair in every single color Great quality stylish lots of compliments Love these  So cute and comfortable The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0they are true to size so comfortable and stylish beautiful color Love them WE LOVE IT I bought a toddler size 8 for our 32months old daughter She absolutely love them Our favorite part of the shoes is the thoughtful design â\\x80\\x94 one side of the tongue is attached to the lace cage so itâ\\x80\\x99s very easy for our daughter to put them on herself We are buying another pair These run really small My grandson wears a size 4 toddler and size 6 was tight and made his feet hurt Not for kids with chubby feet  My son has narrow feet but these would not work for wider feet  These helped my 15 month old run all over the place  I felt good about him having nice support  Great shoe Love these ASICS for our 3 year old daughter  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been buying these sneakers since she started walking  Love that they are easy and quick to put on and the colors match most of her clothes  Her feet are a little wide and this brand fits her better than Nike and Adidas sneakers  She loves that she can put them on by herself now These are comfy shoes that stay well on my kids feet and are easy for her to put on The strap seems to have good life in it but they obviously as white shoes will look new for exactly one day I would buy them again for daycare shoes though We started buying ASICS instead of Stride Rite due to some quality issues we had with one or two pairs This shoe holds up well When my daughter grew out of it we sized up and ordered another pair Was recommended these shoes because my son is a toe walker I think it is helping a little but only time will tell Shoes are great so far Found these sneakers in a list of the best sneakers for the flat feet thought they have good arch support but nope No arch support at all the sole is absolutely flat Maybe its not the manufacturers fault of the false advertising but anyways flat soles are not good for athletic shoes so 4 stars Though they look well made Iâ\\x80\\x99m an ASICS shoe fan myself and these for my toddler did not disappoint So stinking cute with the baseball design He wears them almost daily and theyâ\\x80\\x99ve held up great Seriously considering ordering the next size up My twins have wide feet and these shoes are perfect for them This is their 3rd pair I walk 10 kmday for the las two years Ive been using Air Monarch IV and this  shoes feel more comfortable Quality is top And delivery by Purolator was excellent and fast 3 days before expected Great look and feelThis is my second pairWill buy again great price Those shoes make your feet look quite wide I was not expecting it to be so wide Regardless the shoe is nice and clean tres beau soulier et bon prix Comfortable Good quality running shoe Die Lieferzeit war zwar etwas lang aber das Warten hat sich gelohnt Ein sehr schÃ¶ner Schuh passt wie angegossen Der First pair of addias for many many yearswill buy addias  again TrÃ¨s bon Just the worst I was a little cautious at first 99 for calfskin leather uppers Made in Italy so I decided to order a pair Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I did Very comfortable with generous arch support The sole is a proprietary dainitelike sole The famous rubber studs It was very grippy and it seems hard wearing which I like  Now for the leather Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a smooth leather At first glance I thought it was a waxy suede or a rough out leather It has a matte like finish I do like it It pairs very well with a suit or casual wear Donâ\\x80\\x99t wear any white socks Thereâ\\x80\\x99s some dye issues with the first few wears The shoe is of good leather and strong However the colouring of the shoe is not smart It looks very oddPlus the shoes did not have the blue sole but covers black rubber patch That would make it stronger from friction damage but just mentioning that it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t as presentedI returned for above reason and because the shoe was tight besides saying wide size Shoe looks to be of excellent quality I normally wear a 115 W Only an 11 or 12 was available no half sizes The length fits  perfect but it seems to be a little wider than I expected Overall it is a great looking shoe Yo quisiera la misma bota zai 10 y el mismo color ojo vino favor contestarme para saber di la pido de nuevo This is a beautiful shoe the top of the shoe  is extremely hard leather and cuts into the back of foot hard to wear or enjoy was bleeding after one day on both feet this is my second purchase of this shoeâ\\x80¦ although love the style itâ\\x80\\x99s a waste Excellent color perfect fit perfect thank you Size 13 US wide is slightly small on the 125 side Width is a bit snug at the toes Pull loop broke on first pull  could be better I sent them back as they didnt fit Nice color A little overpriced for the quality and workmanship Shoes are really worth the price and are comfortable Real leather Arrived in good condition within specified time limit It fits perfectly Just loving it solo much toll verarbeitet schÃ¶nes Leder eine weiche Sohle also insgesamt bequem  aber leider nichts fÃ¼r kleine FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe Ich habe 36 und auch so bestellt doch gehen fast alle Hersteller dem Trend nach GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen nach oben zu Ã¤ndern Wenn dann allerdings von unten  also 35 oder 355 nichts nachkommt  sieht es fÃ¼r uns KleinfÃ¼Ã\\x9fige sehr schlecht aus Meist rutscht dann auch noch die Ferse aus dem Schuh hier gehts gerade noch Finde ich sehr schade man mÃ¼sste ja von diesen GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fen keine Unmengen produzieren aber sie auch bedienen ZunÃ¤chst das Positive das Leder ist tatsÃ¤chlich angenehm weich das TragegefÃ¼hl ist sehr angenehm weil der Schuh eine weiche gepolsterte Sohle hat Das war es dann leider auch schon Die VerschweiÃ\\x9fung von Sohle und Leder lÃ¤sst nach nur 5 Monaten deutlich nach Feuchtigkeit und KÃ¤lte dringen ein Die Nieten fÃ¼r die SchnÃ¼rsenkel sind so scharfkantig dass ich bereits mehrere Paar SchnÃ¼rsenkel zerschlissen habe Leider ein Fehlkauf fÃ¼r 80 â\\x82¬ sollte die QualitÃ¤tHaltbarkeit um LÃ¤ngen besser sein Schuhe kamen pÃ¼nktlich an wie gewohnt von AmazonDer Schuh an sich sieht super aus passt perfekt und riecht nach Leder was jedoch nicht heiÃ\\x9ft das er echt Leder ist Mir fehlt leider der eindeutige Hinweis auf echt Leder jedoch geben die Kanten am Schuh Hinweis darauf da diese aufgetaut und nicht glatt sind Eine Anleitung zur Pflege wÃ¤re ganz nett gewesen aber die kann man sich ja im Internet raussuchen Ansonsten super verarbeitet nichts steht weg alles sitzt kleiner heller Fleck an der Seite aber fÃ¤llt fast nicht auf Die Schuhe kamen gut verpackt an Sind auch relativ bequem mir etwas zu eng Aber es ist ja Leder und weitet sich hoffentlich nocht etwas Auch sind mir die SchÃ¼rsenkel zu kurz  Deshalb ein Stern Abzug Diese kÃ¶nnten bei diesem Schuh etwas lÃ¤nger sind dann wÃ¤re es perfekt La piel es muy suave y estÃ¡n bien acabadas El color es mÃ¡s bonito que en la foto es un azul Ã\\xadndigo precioso Calza mas bien holgado pero en mi caso no para pedir un nÃºmero menos Como pega la suela que es un poco rÃ\\xadgida y creo que va a resbalar Son muy cÃ³modas y espero ponÃ©rmelas mucho Tolle QualitÃ¤t weiches

comprÃ© para mi hijoÃ\\x89l usa talla muy grande En esta marca adquirimos talla adecuada y comodidad I am giving 4 stars for comfort though the straps look like its made of plastic I am a big fan of the colors they have used Also it fits beautifully  So 4 stars from me Funciona pero la suela se despinta casi al primer uso y el material del plÃ¡stico da mal olor SÃºper comodidad y de buena calidad me quedaron como lo esperaba el material es ligero y cÃ³modo El color azul es muy padre Amplimamente recomendable I PUSHED my husband into looking at these because he likes to walk on snowy days and has a neuropathy issue in his feet and he makes me nervous on snow and icy patches  Because of artificial hips and some back issues he also has trouble with tie shoes so these seemed perfect  I own two pairs  of Merrillâ\\x80\\x99s and LOVE THEM so I really worked to convince him that he should give these a try HE LOVES THEM He loves how they feel how they look and how they work for him  These are probably the most expensive shoes he has ever bought but he will tell you worth every penny  Iâ\\x80\\x99m delighted becausewellI was right Replaced another pair that wore out after 5 years of heavy useThe soles are not slip resistant like kitchen shoes made with slip resistant soles but my husband uses them anyway due to comfort Really liked the shoe  nice construction looks good seems wellmadeOnly problem that it was was narrow and tight even in a size 11 I normally wear a 105So snug that I could barely get the shoes onto my feet  Even getting them off was a struggleAlmost too long in length so the next size up would not have solved the problemFor the right feet these probably will be a nice pair of shoes I bought these to replace a pair of slipons Ive worn for twenty years and these have become my goto footwear They are warm waterproof and have provided perfect traction on ice and snow Im not a graceful person so if theyre keeping me standing on slick surfaces then I know they really work The fit is a little snug but not uncomfortable at all If you want a pair of shoes you can slip on and go anywhere in regardless of weather then these are it I owned a pair of Merrell shoes that I wore for years until they wore out and I bought these as a replacement They fit great are extremely comfortable and look good I wanted a pair of slipon shoes that I could wear to the office or on a hike and these succeed in both They are nice looking leather and look like regular black leather shoes but they also have specially made highgrip soles which will do well in winter ice They are very comfortable look good and I highly recommend them Im very happy with Merrell shoes and when these wear out in ten years Ill probably buy another pair from them Ive only had them for a week however they are comfortable and seem well made  I like that they are slipon and quite easy to slip into  Just yesterday I did encounter some ice on my sidewalk  I was very pleased with the traction the ice tread does work  I wear these to the office as well and they are not too hot or cold After a year of wear these still slip on tight with a satisfying thuck  The heal tops havent broken down even though I rarely pull them on with my hands  just stuff my feet into them  Very comfortable dont wiggle or slip but arent tight or binding great on snow and other infirm surfaces and great looking with a pair of jeans  From afternoon walks to bar hopping these are the first shoes I grab  I generally wear a 12D even though my feet are a little narrower than that with a high instep and these fit really well I bought these for my husband  his second pair  He wore his first pair for about 5 years until they wore out  A good looking sturdy shoe for walking and working outside  He says there is no breaking in period  He is very loyal to the Merrill brand and believes they are a good value They seem to run true to size when compared with other similar Merrell shoes Ive owned Ive owned 3 or 4 pairs of Merrells and was impressed by each one Pretty decent grip I live in a land of ice for 5 months out of the year and while I wouldnt wear these for extreme excursions getting around in parking lot or on a sidewalk with patches of ice these arent a bad choice I had been looking at this particular color and size show for 18 months They finally came down a smidge to the price I was looking for This pair fits perfectly and the soles of this pair are perfect for winter season coming up Well I live in Phoenix Metro Before I lived in COS these would have been perfect I do recommend this pair completely and the vendor was terrific Product arrived earlier than anticipated This shoes is perfect to size The heel was uncomfortably tight Just not the Reebok shoe I remember I was looking for a solid black sneaker for my child to wear to private school  These are comfortable fit well are adjustable and reasonably priced Normally I love Classics for my kids but this one was only worn for a week when the bottom fell off ONE WEEK I was really disappointed Nice sneakers and comfortable  Good for the price My  niece have have one of those since she is in school  she is 7 years old now so  hers are a little old and small so i showed her some others of a diferent brand  and she told me no buy my the same one and i reply but those others are beautifull and pretty and she  told me no mine are more confortable and pretty I want the same one So i purchase it again The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Â\\xa0They said the shoes was made in Vietnam and I received it just now and it shows made in China  am so disappointed ð\\x9f\\x98\\x9e ð\\x9f\\x98ª When i was young these used to be three best school shoesnow my daughter has a pair love

correttaCONTROIl colore delle scarpe Ã¨ diverso da quello della fotoLa scarpa destra presenta rigature sulla pelle esterna ed interna come da foto e non aveva linserto per mantenere la forma sembra sia una scarpa espostaNon richiederÃ² un reso ma ritengo decisamente preferibile meno solerzia nella consegna e piÃ¹ correttezza nella coerenza con quanto esposto nella foto e nella qualitÃ\\xa0Inoltre sullo store Lumberjack il modello con il colore che mi Ã¨ arrivato Ã¨ venduto ad un prezzo inferiore Comincio nel descrivere la scarpa che Ã¨ di buonissima fattura e il cui unico tallone dachille Ã¨ forse la suola meno confortevole del modello Timberland che ha un minimo di rimbalzo ma diciamo che non da fastidio a meno che non ci facciate i km in una seraPer quanto concerne gli accorgimenti da seguire Se non avete giÃ\\xa0 provato la scarpa scegliete un numero in meno del vostro calzano larghe non tanto dalla  punta ma dal tallone escono proprio Io porto il 42 e il 41 mi sta bene E una scarpa che va portata dal calzolaio appena indossata vi accorgerete che non Ã¨ un cuoio che cede facilmente al vostro piede e a meno che non vogliate delle vesciche sui mignoli e sui talloni come successo a me portatele da un calzolaio e fatele mettere in forma un paio di giorniAl ritorno vi accorgerete di quanto la scarpa calzi meglio e non soffrirete per nullaLa sto usando spesso e lho acquistata da circa una 20ina di giorniAcquisto consigliato ma seguite questi accorgimenti Ho una scarpa identica ma di quattro anni fa pertanto ho fatto lordine abbastanza sicuro che sarebbe andata bene Questa ha la suola con le stesse misure ma Ã¨ importabile tanto Ã¨ stretta Non capisco se Ã¨ un difetto ma stando al venditore il modello potrebbe essere stata modificato Consiglio lacquisto alle persone che hanno un piede affusolato poco largo e con un collo stretto Certamente nella descrizione andrebbe puntualmente segnalata la cosa ma cosÃ¬ non Ã¨ Infine il reso NON E GRATUITO pertanto per quanto mi riguarda MEGLIO ANDARE IN NEGOZIO Nulla da dire sulle scarpe sono nuove e calzano perfettamente ma una certa opacita sulla tomaia fa immaginare che non siano appena uscite dalla fabbrica lucide e splendenti come quelle che si vedono in foto In piÃ¹ fra luna e laltra ho notaro una leggera decolorazione come se una scarpa fosse stata esposta alla luce di piÃ¹ dellaltra Non perfette quindi ma comunque senza difetti vistosi che ne pregiudichino luso e per il prezzo pagato 52 euro vanno piÃ¹ che bene le scarpe tipo barca della Lumberjack sono anni che le uso nel periodo estivo per la loro comoditÃ\\xa0 leggerezza e durabilitÃ\\xa0 Uso lumberjack da anni e mi sono trovato sempre benebello il colore e calzano perfettamente io porto la 43 Le lumberjeck di

descrizione della ditta Arrivato nei tempi giusti Ne avevo giÃ\\xa0 un paio ora consumate le ho ricomperate perchÃ¨ ci cammino bene Prodotto conforme I have almost 100 pair of shoes and these are among some of the ones I only wear occasionally because they hurt and leave blisters on my feet I even changed the insoles thinking that might help but no cigar If youre the type that wears socks then maybe these are for you but I live in Florida and socks are just WAY TOO HOT So unless Im wearing boots I go barefoot in all my shoes Now these look good but fall short in the comfort area Just my two cents The first walk with these shoes the soles started to crumble off like maybe the rubber was not hardened or just too soft to be used on a shoe sole  It was minor at first and I let it go now 3 months later I do not wear these every day there are major sections of the sole completely worn off and a support wire inside has popped outI sent pictures and a description to the dockers customer service email and have never heard back Great looking shoe light weight and was very comfortable after i change out the insoles The insoles that come with them are not good Add another 10 bucks to you shoes and they are great Took almost 2 weeks for delivery and were a little to large Great shoe at a great price Pefectosquiero otros Perfect fit Super lightweight shoes Fits well and is very light

I purchased the Wild Dove for my son because it was listed as unisex and the colors looked gray blue and orange  The actual colors are gray purple and coral pink  Hope that helps someone  Please mark if this review was helpful Very comfortable and well worth the price  Teva is a very good company The shoes are very well constructed My future daughter inlaw liked mine so much I bought her a pair as well She could not get over that they are kids shoes as she and I have small feet and its hard to find nice shoes in the stores in our size The caption under the description of these shoes advises to get one size under your actual size as these run big And the caption is correct I could really wear a 4 in these but  bought a 5 and they are actually a little big and I normally wear size 5 But I love them  I like them and they provide good grip and protection while being airy for my sweaty baby LOL But there are two problems They are verrrrry stiff I cant bend them without feeling like they might start spiting I guess that makes them a little tougher Also we now have about 5 pairs of the same size shoes for our 17 month old daughter They all seem to be pretty close aside from these They are a little big The issue with is for the most part they are meant to be worn without socks The shoes being to big and being worn without socks will cause the lacing systemtongue to bunch up and hurt  I would say if you could order two on amazon wardrobe One size down and one the regular size your little one wearsIve never been a good student so please excuse my poor writing thumbs up Je

avec cette marque Chassures solides bien finies originales It fits to size easy to slip on If you have a high arch you may have an issue slipping them on Loving these shoes Some have mentioned them being hard to get on but I had no problem No shoe horn needed I bought the black Hawaiian print Ordered my usual size and fit perfectly Nice cushion inside but of wearing for a lot of walking you definitely want to wear some kind of ankle socks as they rub a bit on the pinkie toe after awhile  I wore them at a festival for about six hours No blistersno painjust a little rubbing on top of pinkie toe after a few hours Easy to clean tossed in wash on cold and air dried perfect ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8cð\\x9f\\x98\\x8e These run small Iâ\\x80\\x99m usually an 885 so I ordered 85 they are way too small So order up at least 1 size I gave them to my daughter who is a size 6 They are cute though Mein Sohn liebt diese Schuhe Fallen kleiner aus Va bene Scarpa morbidissimaComprata per utilizzare a lavoro molto comoda Toller leichter Schuh Las zapatillas son muy bonitas como en la foto Las he tenido que devolver porque tengo los pies anchos y las notaba justas El largo perfecto Passen sehr gut richtig guter Tragekomfort Sehr guter Preis Gern immer wieder ARA Schuhe haben etwas besonderes ich liebe diese Marke Danke Schuhe  GroÃ\\x9fe 38 Toller Schuh sehr bequem Ich habe 5 Paar Halbschuhe von Berkemann  alle in derselben GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe und PassformDieser Sneaker ist sehr leicht und ideal fÃ¼r den Sommer aber er ist Ã¼ber eine Daumenbreite lÃ¤nger nicht breiter als die vergleichbaren Halbschuhe in identischer GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe Daher leider zurÃ¼ck Scarpe comode e belle le consiglio davvero Un buen producto con una buena oferta Really adorablealthough wideIm a size 6 regular and always a size 6These are like a 6 12 wide so my feet slid out walkingI crochet a smaller insert and glued it in the front because the inside is furry and slippery but they are literally that cute so I had to keep themI almost sent them back but 6 is the smallest sizeThat being saidI do love them for all their troubleð\\x9f\\x99\\x82ð\\x9f\\x92\\x95 Super cute shoe I have really high arches and dont know how comfy these will be to walk in but I like the look Why no instructions on how to clean though These are not very comfortable to wear very long  they hurt the tops of my feet I get a lot of compliments when I wear them Super Ive now purchased 3 pairs of these They are the most comfortable walking shoes I have found by far and I walk about 1520 miles per day on a treadmill desk THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU SHOULD KNOW  there are two versions being sold here One version is Made in the USA and the other version is made elsewhere You can easily tell which version you are looking at because the US version says Made in the USA on both the tung and side of the shoe The nonUSA version is more comfortable but less durable Also the USA version runs about 1 size small I enjoy wearing both about equally The US version is better for running the international version is more suited for walking See pix I absolutely love the look of this shoe and the fact socks donâ\\x80\\x99t need to be worn with them I returned the normal size I always get since they felt way too big Went down half a size and they were fairly tight I stuck with the smaller size since I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to wear socks with them and the hope theyâ\\x80\\x99d break in just a little they have just a bit This shoe runs slightly narrow in the toe box and no support for running which I assumed before buying They arenâ\\x80\\x99t as â\\x80\\x9cbreathable I thought they would be as well The biggest issue Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had is even just walking my dog in them the insoles constantly would move Iâ\\x80\\x99d have to take off my shoe and adjust it multiple times in just a few miles I had to glue them down I really love the look but if youâ\\x80\\x99re actually moving in them they donâ\\x80\\x99t perform I prefer Nike flyknit free run shoes if you want sockless shoes you can actually walk in These things looked really comfortable I got about what I expected but it was not as good as I thought it would bethe uppers are all an elastic material Nothing hard even above the heel You slip them on like a slipper the laces do nothing and are just for show Elastic pulls your feet tight against the sole So it is essentially like a slipper with a shoe sole Unfortunately that make them kind of hot It is a little hard to get the shoe on without getting a wrinkle in your sock and that will make your feet hurt after a little while The thing I like least about the shoe is that it feels and sounds like you are walking in galoshes they flap a little when you walkThey are not terrible and they look good I will wear them until they wear out but I will not buy another pair Ive never owned a pair of shoes quite like these before so maybe its on me for not going in with the right expectations but I fine that these shoes are not suitable to be your everyday shoe The woven sock like nature is comfortable for short periods but after a few months of wearing them every day Ive found that the lack of support they give your feet actually leaves them feeling more sore than a normal shoe and my knees have started hurting I think these would be great for times when youre not in them for very long but I wouldnt recommend them if youre looking for a shoe to wear for 10hours a day I have one word to say wow I am a huge New balance fan and I love their shoes for years I thought it would give this style a chance and man am I happy They are so comfortable so soft I just cant say enough good things about them So Im stocked up for the future I bought another five pairs reason about so many sometimes on Amazon or other places you buy shoe and you love it and then five months or six months later down the road you want to buy that same pair and you cant find it So what Ive been doing the past year so is just buying multiple pairs so I dont run out Theyre extremely sharp looking with jeans and shorts They look sharp for casual and workI am so pleased with these shoes these got to buy far be the best new balance in the most comfortable and extremely goodlooking shoe When you first put them on youre like wow I said these are amazing and they are get them and you wont be disappointed Just a smidge too big but may be doable w socks It sucks cause I wanted to go sockless w these Im going to consider keeping them for the look and price Dang Im already returning my other NB I just ordered from here same issue Cool shoes but you may want to go 1 12 down if you have a more narrow foot Update Returning them They are big and provide no protection for the toesies All I feel is my big toe nail poking thru the shoe Ill be better off wearing house shoes to the gym Shoes feel great as expected from the fresh foam technology First shoe I have had with truly sock fit structure so take a little getting used to If your feet are a bit smaller or donâ\\x80\\x99t fill out the structure  they will lose some of that tightening them up with the laces but feels good and if you like a looser less structured shoe they are great Look great and very stylish IMO These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet Itâ\\x80\\x99s unbelievable You feel like you donâ\\x80\\x99t have on shoes but little clouds So far so good I have put just over 20 road miles on these shoes in the first three days and the shoes are comfortable plush and forming to my feet The shoes seem durable but I donâ\\x80\\x99t know yet With such a soft sock like upper I was concerned they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have support but they do The upper is really comfortableOne small negative the front tongue is high and started to uncomfortably rub the front of my ankles but easily solved by folding the tongue over stayed folded on a 7 miler or with taller socks Super cute  Warm  Fit like Skechers runners True to sizeCat approved Para mÃ\\xad gusto son pesados I have to wear more shoes with ankle support and these do really good I had thought they would be way heavy on me feet but no they feel good they have enough room for your tooties to say oh wow I can relax out finally so yes I give these awesome shoe boots a 5 thank you sketchers and thank you Amazon Gods Blessing to all Stay Safe  Love these sneakers They fit perfectly and have received many compliments  So comfortable and warm  I have leather boots I can no longer wear because they are too heavy for me to walk in so these are perfect I use a walker is why leather boots are too heavy for me You will love them I would say cant wait for winter to wear em but NAH I enjoy the summer But I will say that are comfy inside flexible sole and seem warm Im happy I purchased them To me they are true to size as well Super cute and are comfortable very cozy lots of complements Bei diesen Schuhen ist schon beim ersten Tragen der Stoff

hatten Ich denke ein Schuh in dieser Preiskategorie sollte schon bisschen lÃ¤nger haltenDie 2 Sterne gibt es fÃ¼rs Aussehen und die ElastizitÃ¤t Sono arrivati in anticipo giÃ\\xa0 li porta mio figlio da un poâ\\x80\\x99 di giorni sembra un buon prodotto Tolle sehr leichte Schuhe die gut gedÃ¤mpft sind Ã\\x9cber die Haltbarkeit kann ich noch nicht viel sagen Auf jeden Fall wirkt dieses Produkt sehr wertig und unserem 4 jÃ¤hrigen haben sie auf Anhieb sehr gefallen Bonitas y cÃ³modas  buena calidad SchÃ¶n und schicker Schuh Eigentlich mag ich Socken von nur die Aber diese sind nichts Ultra dÃ¼nn mit noch dÃ¼nneren Stellen die einem dann als BelÃ¼ftung verkauft werden Ich halte es eher fÃ¼r eine Sollbruchstelle Auch sind die Socken sehr rutschig Man rutscht im Schuh der bei mehreren anderen Marken Socken gut sitzt wie verrÃ¼ckt herum Nervig Gut dass ich nur ein Paar zum probieren bestellt habe I like Nur Die socks because they are made of bambus which make them super airy Perfect for summer They are indeed little bit smaller if you consider sizes and there is no big dofference between sizes 3538 and 3942 but I would say if you are up to size 37 order smaller one and if you are 3840 order bigger one Over 40 it wont fit well Obwohl die Socken super dÃ¼nn sind sind sie sehr saugfÃ¤hig und luftdurchlÃ¤ssig Perfekt fÃ¼r den Sommer Die Socken sind unglaublich weich und angenehm zu tragen Halten auch nach vielen WÃ¤schen ihre Form Ein Stern Abzug weil jedes Paar in einer PlastiktÃ¼te verpackt war Das ist nun wirklich absolut unnÃ¶tig und nicht mehr zeitgemÃ¤Ã\\x9f Sonst hÃ¤tte ich 5 Sterne gegeben sehr angenehmes weiches Material Man bekommt keine SchwitzfÃ¼Ã\\x9fe perfekt im Sommer Bought these shoes for my great niece They fit well and are comfortable She absolutely loves them Shes a picky little princess so its always a gamble getting her clothing or shoes These shoes however she really loves My daughter lives these shoes She jumps in them and loves the lights Too bad they only light up on one side They appear lightweight and therefore comfortable Happy with my purchase We got these as a cheap daycare shoe but they are amazing quality I expected the little â\\x80\\x9cdiamondsâ\\x80\\x9d to fall off easily or the lights to stop working sheâ\\x80\\x99s rough on shoes at daycare but they are all still in tact  lights still work perfectly I think we will get a lot of life out of these  I will absolutely buy the next size up when itâ\\x80\\x99s time My daughter loves her light up shoes Theyre definitely light weight and so far they havent come apart If they continue to hold up they were definitely worth every penny paid The bottoms are slippery which was disappointing  My little kiddo kept slipping with them on These were for my granddaughter who loves them Though my daughter loved these but was disappointed that it doesnt light up in one shoe I will have to return these Easy on easy off very comfortable Comfy to kid feet I bought these for my son to grow into but my daughter liked them so much she wanted them for herself These are so very cute and I would say unisex because of the preppy tennis shoe look My daughter likes to pair them with denim and something pink and its a great combo of tomboy and girlygirl The material is thick the sole is sturdy and the stitching is clean Very good quality shoe at an excellent price I am ordering another pair for my son Fit as expected but my son has worn them 3 times and the inside is coming up already I was able to glue it back down but kinda sucks to have to do that to a brand new pair of shoes Son loves them my boy loves them they fit perfectly No additional comments Fine Me quedo perfectamente muy bien era lo que esperaba Los zapatos de excelente calidad recomendados al 100 lo malo fue que le quedaron grandes a mi novio era un regalo es su nÃºmero 29 pero Le quedaron grande Traten de pedir una talla menos por ejemplo mi novio es 29 un 285 Le hubiera quedado mejor Suerte Me gusto mucho  justo como esperaba Calidad genial excelente EstÃ¡n sÃºper padrÃ\\xadsimos y muy cÃ³modos Muy comodos me encanto Todo perfecto They look good and ok material quality If you want to wear them for sitting at your desk they are fine but they provide zero support and although fitting snug the material is so weak that your feet are flying left and right Itâ\\x80\\x99s feeling dangerous at many points I twisted my ankle first time running with them when making a change in direction I find them dangerous and wonâ\\x80\\x99t wear them for work out So Ive never spwnt more then 2500 on a pair of shoes and ive always just bought shoes from walmart i can honestly say thisbwas worth the money and i will never by a pair of shoes from walmart The media

se dÃ©colle Super comodissime Iâ\\x80\\x99ve owned at least 15 pair of Allen Edmonds shoes over the years so I was particularly disappointed with these The fit with my usual size 115 EEE was uncomfortably tight length and width and the leather seemed thin and far from what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come to expect I returned them immediately Nice quality AE shoes Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not made in the US but I knew that when I bought them They look very good Very good Im using them in mowing a steep hill and they do a plenty good job of giving me the necessary grip They look fantastic and seem to be made out of excellent materialsI have 2 issues with theseFirst the wide width size is not quite wide They feel standard width and that is thought on my feet and makes them a little uncomfortable to wear for a very prolonged periodSecond the heel is a bit low and very stiff so at one point it slid off and back on just a little and cut my heel pretty badIf you are fine with the low tops or use thick socks and if you dont have especially wide feet I highly recommend these shoes New Balanxe is the best bar none My sons a high school pitcher We bought Nikeâ\\x80\\x99s and realized his mechanics were off Turned out his ankles were rolling in on the Nikeâ\\x80\\x99s heâ\\x80\\x99s got flat feet So we went back to tried and trie NB For perfect excellent support all around and the only baseball clear that does a true wide Double bonus they like so cool and the price point was insane 13 the price of the Nikeâ\\x80\\x99s Highly Recomended My son loves these He said they are comfortable to run in and fits perfect Itâ\\x80\\x99s a little tighter than expected Iâ\\x80\\x99d go a half size up Goof shoe very comfortable These flats are really comfortable for my wide feet I ordered a regular 95 since the wide wasnt available These dont squish my toes unlike other shoes I can wear it with thick socks I would have tried 9W but it wasnt available and the 95 works well as the toe box is wide Daughter is 12 years old and decide to try tap Bought these for reason of cost and uncertainties of her likening tap These shoes have held up extremely well to much abuse from tap shoes remain looking like new They fit her feet well She has zero complaints The shoes are great Deep enough for my inserts  The Velcro closure is very easy to put on or take off I am wearing them constantlyBeing elderly they will make a difference as I had a fall recentlyMOui Are you kidding me I wear a 9 but I ordered a 10 and they are still 2 sizes too small There is actually a 41 sticker on the bottom Id say that the 10 is equivalent to a size 7 Los compre para un adulto mayor no resbalan son comodos y suaves I normally wear a size 7 womens  I ordered size 7 12  The shoes arrived with stickers on the soles stating that they are size 38  Size 38 in Europe is the equivalent of a size 8 here so they should have been large for me  Instead they are so small I cannot even squeeze my feet into them I will be returning them tomorrow Son sÃºper cÃ³modos y fÃ¡ciles de limpiar sÃ³lo que vienen un poco grandes I normally wear a 95 but ordered a 10 These were so small there was no way my foot would even come close to squeezing in very comfortable   soft letter  will buy other pair later Really nice Es ist bereits mein zweites Paar Kong Derbys Das erste war aus Glattleder und leider ist diese an der Spitze nicht sehr haltbar und auch bein normaler Nutzung sahen die frÃ¼h schÃ¤bbig ausDas Problem hat diese Variante nicht sie sehen trotzdem gut aus und nicht Ã¼bertrieben nach Wanderschuhen oder soNur an den Sohlen dÃ¼rfte Think noch nachbessern Ich sag nur Schotterparkplatz FÃ¼r mich mÃ¼sste Think zu diesen Schuhen eine Hufkratzer dazulegen I needed shoes that were comfortable had arch support fit my difficult feet and looked nice and professional for work Im young and a lot of shoes that fit the bill arent cute but these look good and as a bonus they work great with socks especially fun ones that poke through the cut outs I walk several miles a day in them and they were comfortable from day one I find myself reaching for them everyday when picking out what to wear This is the first pair of shoes Ive found that I cant find a single complaint with Ive already picked out the next pair of Propet shoes Im going to buy My Granddaughter loves them Ich liebe diese Schuhe Sie schmiegen sich an den Fuss an und laufen wie von selbst Gewohnt hervorragend gearbeitet und aus den besten Materialien Da lohnt sich jeder Cent den man dafÃ¼r ausgegeben hat Dazu langlebig keine Wegwerfware sondern haltbar ohne Ende Ich habe schon seit 10 Jahren ein Paar das immer noch nicht ausgetreten ist obwohl ich sie regelmÃ¤Ã\\x9fig trage Also auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert These Propet shoes are comfortable I ordered a 10 narrow  I normally wear a 10 but measure a AAA rather than a AA so I knew these shoes might be a bit wide They fit well with heavier socks I can add an insole and wear them with tights or light socks They do not have as thick cushioning or as much arch support as SAS Roamers but for one third the price they are good and comfortable shoes They do not have a deep toe box That doesnt bother me but it might be an issue for some Sizes are a little small My daughter just started fitting in size 1 and the size one was too small Ich wollte einen nachhaltigen Schuh kaufen Ob Think wirklich nachhaltig ist also in Arbeitsbedingungen Materialien sowie Herstellungsverfahren kann ich nicht definitiv sagen Der Schuh ist schÃ¶n nach einem Tag Einlaufzeit sitzt er top Wie es mit der Langlebigkeit ist werde ich sehen Derzeit top Purchased for my mother who needs good support  She has the other style propetâ\\x80\\x99 Mary Jane and really likes them  Took a chance on a slightly different style and she loves them  They fit true to size stay on with no heel slipping good traction on bare floors  The shoe does not rub or cut the foot as some new shoes may  Very comfortable from the start  Definitely recommend They irritate my daughters back ankle a little but are otherwise wonderful Vor Ã¼ber 20 Jahren habe ich meinen ersten Think gekauft und dann immer mal wieder Noch heute ist er qualitativ sehr gut und das Design ist klasse Ich bin jedenfalls begeistert Love my Propet shoes I recently purchased this style for fallwinterThe material is a suedelike brushed leather upper Soft and pretty in blackThe insole is very cushionyI wore them to the grocery yesterday just to try them out They are much too snug across the top of my feet  When I took them off my feet were swollen  Im keeping them in hopes they will stretch out a bit8w Perfect tap shoes daughter loved the clasp easy to take on and off Super bequem Ich trage die nur noch In anderen Schuhen fÃ¼hle ich mich eingeengt I have bought the biggest size available and it just about fits my son I would have loved to buy one size bigger These kind of sandals are not found so often I would have loved if they made these sandals for all foot sizes These shoes are very comfortable I am a greeter at church and they are super comfortable I have Neuropathy Fibromyalgia and Arthritis so I need good and comfortable shoes Not great for kids with wide feet Passt einfach ohne vorher anprobiert zu haben Perfekt verarbeitet Mi hijo es 205 y pedi 21  le quedo muy comodo Vienen amplios del dorso Solo me enviaron color gris y pedi color el verde Meine GroÃ\\x9f ist normalweise 46  aber es ist klein mit diese ShuheMÃ¶chte gerne 465 Was soll ich machen  My son likes the bright color Its comfortable and light weight GUte QualitÃ¤t Superbe paire de chaussures exactement le model en photo magnifique  Damaged products received 2 times disappointed with quality of Skechers First time quality related issue in Skechers super Schuhweiches Leder und passt genau AchetÃ©es pour mon fils pour remplacer ses prÃ©cÃ©dentes chaussures Je ne suis pas un grand fan des achats de vÃªtements sur internet mais lÃ\\xa0 cest impeccable et la qualitÃ© REDSKINS Me encantaron y a mi niÃ±a mas  EstÃ¡n hermosos King kong ist super Chaussures portÃ©es une 20aine de fois les semelles se dÃ©collent Les coutures donnent des signes de faiblessePassez votre chemin Love the shoes TrÃ¨s belles chaussures These are terrible I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe theyâ\\x80\\x99re actually Skechers I have worn many Skechers shoes of different types over the years and have bought many different kinds for my girls These are the first pair Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever felt that have super uncomfortable interiors Theyâ\\x80\\x99re water shoes so theyâ\\x80\\x99re meant to be worn without socks yet the inside seam where the fabric backing is stitched to the main part of the shoe is so scratchy My girls each tried on a pair and both were exactly the same inside so I am returning both Weâ\\x80\\x99ll be going with Speedo brand water shoes this year These shoes were really cute on and the neoprene back made them easier to get on and off than the classic style I thought it would make it comfortable as well however the neoprene is sewn into the shoe with a rather large sharp seam at the ankle I ordered these for 2 children and both complained of the sharpness and had red marks within 2 minute of walking around the house Sad because they were great in theory The shoes are nice but they dont have the proper size chart loaded on this Amazon page  These little kids shoes say age 48 My soon to be 4 years old son wears a size 9 toddler shoe so I thought since the size 6 was on sale I would get it for him to grow into later  Turns out its the same as a toddler size 6 shoe Why dont they say age 04 toddler then  And the big kid size must really be for little kids 48Shoes are great just need a better description and size chart  Hope this helps any other mom wondering the same  I so wanted to love these First off they are so pretty The gold and pale pink combo looked great in person I wanted a shoe my little one could slip on without assistance from me or having to sit down to put them on Unfortunately these were not it The neoprene back has almost no give so to put  on required sitting down and even then she struggled to get these on herself I told her she could also wear them as a slip on and step on the neoprene backing but she complained that it felt uncomfortable under her foot That was a feature I thought she would love to get out the door even quicker but again this was not the case If the backing had more stretch it could be the perfect slip on water friendly shoe  Well be sticking to Natives and Crocs for our go to summer shoes I was so bummed these didnt work out for us Sie sind anders  als abgebildet Vorne nur Stoff Shoe packaging is nice the shoe looks just as pictured if not better The only con is i hste shoes that have shoe laces more for decorations then actual shoe lace needs This shoe has just that shoe laces that serve no purpose really They are like slide in sneakers Iâ\\x80\\x99m a huge fan of this brand The shoes always fit and never leave blisters Great quality Super cute My daughter loves them They fit pretty true to size My daughter loved them I bought a 5 size bigger she said they fit awesome Thumbs up Cute and comfortable So far so good fit so good and  the color is great fits comfty First pair of theses but i like them The product is not sold as advertise It is too hard on the foot and feels more plastic then rubber I like them Love these flip flops I owned a pair similar to these and they were just worn out so I took a chance and ordered some from Amazon I was very pleased that they fit as expected and are very comfortable There is substantial support for a flip flop with good wide straps that are desired A little squeaky at first and takes a few days to wear that squeak out as the foot molds the foam Hubby loves the comfort and style and I love the price Wore them for my beach wedding Comfortable and fit well I am going to buy another pair My husband loves these This is the first time I have been able to get him to not always wear his tennis shoes Slip on and go So perfect for him and he loves the look These seemed like very nice flip flops Sadly I am a 13 shoe and the 1213 are a little too small for me Some people would consider this a tight fit but to me it is very comfortable and secure I purchased 2 more pairs after I received my first ones in the mail Nice attractive flip flops but the size 1213 does not fit my husbands size 13 foot Meine FuÃ\\x9flÃ¤nge betrÃ¤gt 27cm und ich habe 425 bestellt Nunja wenn man breitere FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe hat wÃ¼rde ich zur 43 greifen und werde auch diese nachbestellen Die Verarbeitung ist super und die Schuhe sind leicht Ich habe auf anderen Seiten gelesen das diese groÃ\\x9f ausfallen sollen und habe leider dementsprechen eine halbe Nummer kleiner bestellt Yo pedi talla 20 mx y llego una totalmente diferente es mas el producto que se ve en la imagen tiene agujeta y el que a mi me llego trae velcro Excelente me apoye en la tabla de tamaÃ±os de Amazon y quedaron mÃ¡s que bien El diseÃ±o y la calidad de New BalanceSon cÃ³modos fÃ¡ciles de poner y quitar Los tenis esta muy chicos yo quiero cambiar los tenis querÃ\\xada un nÃºmero 21 de MÃ©xico y segÃºn yo decÃ\\xada asÃ\\xad en los que peci La caja llegÃ³ muy daÃ±ada Excelente le gustaron mucho a mi hija I got these after reading up on the best shoes for toddlers with pronation My toddler loves them and his ankles and arches look more supported in these than in the majority of his other shoes They are a little more expensive than the typical stride rite shoes that I have gotten in the past but these have a lot of support and seem to be plenty comfortable for my active toddler I chose these shoes specifically because I wanted laced shoes for my toddler A pair of laced shoes is shown in the photo however I received a pair of Velcro shoes in the same colordesign So perhaps if you order a size 8W like I did you may end up with Velcro shoes so just be prepared Too small had to return It also doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look like very good craftsmanship inn the show itself Shoes look good but I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand why would you send Velcro when picture clearly shows laces I canâ\\x80\\x99t be bothered to send them back especially since I know they wonâ\\x80\\x99t be replacing them with the correct shoes I wish I had seen the other reviews The rim of the heal area rubs at the back of the ankle It is comfortable Send it to my dad He loves it I like the color Not comfortable at all is ok Jai dabord achetÃ© ce produit en fonction des cm du pieds de ma 145 cm soit 26 de pointure sur le tableau et jai du faire un Ã©change car les chaussons faisaient presque 20 cm de long Ã\\x89changÃ©s donc avec une pointure 22 et les chaussons allaient parfaitementIls sont super jolies et douillets seul bÃ©mol il manque une languette a larriÃ¨re pour faciliter lenfilage mon mari na jamais rÃ©ussi Ã\\xa0 les mettre sur ma fille Je pense quavec un pied plus fort impossible a mettre Lo non le ho piÃ¹ acquistate Die QualitÃ¤t ist nicht so gut TrÃ¨s belle lÃ©gÃ¨re taille bien rien a dire Excelente artÃ\\xadculo solo el color no me terminÃ³ por agradar de ahÃ\\xad en fuera todo estÃ¡ muy bien EstÃ¡n muy bonitos y de buena calidad solo que me enviaron 65 en vez de 55 pero aÃºn asÃ\\xad se les darÃ¡ uso aquÃ\\xad Muy bien llego a tiempo la calidad muy bienn Comodos ligeros excelente calidad If your child has high arches and high bridge go with the WIDE width instead of the Medium width The elastic band under the shoe laces will be too small for a high bridge foot and cause discomfort Go WIDE Itâ\\x80\\x99s a beautiful light weight shoe and my 9yr old really enjoys they way they feel He especially like the heel cup as it rides slightly high with a large tab that he can get a good hold of as he slips them on and off We will be ordering more pairs in different colors Perfect sneaker for active kids They are lightweight and easy for my kids to put on Not knowing how to tie these laces stay tied longer considering the rope type lace and the boys can just slide them right one The back is more of a rubber material which helps allow room for the heal to easily slide in  Having two 5 year old twins these shoes being simple to put on saves me time on busy school mornings  They have worn them since March pretty much every day through a bike riding hiking the park and riding their scooters  They hold up very well I bought these in July for my daughter to start school in August of 2021 We love the shoes in general we owned the gray last year with no problems However i bought the navy this year and they broke not even 3 weeks in I fixed with a threadneedle now fast forward to today 102221 They broke again and are unraveling I am not satisfied with how they are made Other than that it is a good shoe but the eyelets where the strings go through are not sturdy at all I bought for a girl so i can about imagine a boy may be even harder on the shoe I ordered a big kids 65 which in most shoes fits perfect These are a little big So order true size Other that that dont not rip tag off of strings this will cause the lace loop to break Pretty decent shoes Loved the fit and color of this sneaker  However less than a week out of the box and normal wear the side of the shoe ripped  Really surprised that that happened Shoe lace eyelet broke sent back and got another pair Next day broke in same spot Donâ\\x80\\x99t buy  Then charges a 1051 restocking fee  Ridiculous  Even after I tried to try a second pair These are very comfy and cute sneakers  My foot tends to be average to narrow width so if you have a wide foot you might have a problem I love the color Looks like it costs twice the price Naturalizer has always been a favorite of mine and this shoe is again a hit Item not as described  not real leather all man made which led to squeaking and sore heels Very disappointed too late to return I needed these for physical therapy  Iâ\\x80\\x99m very satisfied I usually wear a 75M  I bought a 7W  they are fine Son muy lindos pero la calidad no es buena Apenas tenÃ\\xadan dos dias de uso y se descosturo la lengÃ¼eta cute but not real leather Au dÃ©part assez dures comme toutes les dr Martens elles font un peu souffrir Mais câ\\x80\\x99est aussi le gage de leur rÃ©sistance PrÃ©voir des grosses chaussettes et des pansements au bout dâ\\x80\\x99une semaine elles sont adaptÃ©es Ã\\xa0 votre pied ne font plus mal et vous durerons toute la vie Very disappointed It was advertised as leather but this is a plastic shoeThe shape did not seem right either I own several pairs of docs and those just donâ\\x80\\x99t seem right El calzado es bueno la amortiguaciÃ³n boost se siente en plenitud si tienes el pie amplio lo puedes sentir ajustado  En mi caso en la parte de los dedos sentÃ\\xad que la altura del tenis es un poco reducida y mi dedo gordo se asoma sobre el tejido  No me agradaron los cojinetes de la zona del talÃ³n no dan un soporte adecuado y en ocasiones sientes que el pie puede salir  Rescato la amortiguaciÃ³n boost y el agarra sobre cualquier tipo de suelo This is the first pair of Adidas basketball shoes i have owned and so far I am impressed The boost soles add a noticeable amount of cushion and the toe shape is wide which is perfect for me feet I often have a problem with my toes being too cramped in basketball shoes causing my toenails to break all the time So far I havent had that problem with these There is also pronounced cushion ridges in the lining at the heel which keeps your feet planted inside the shoe which is a must for balling in low tops So far I am impressed I just hope they hold up to wear and tear These shoes are way wider than they look Felt like I was wearing swim flippers If you only wear these in doors you dont have to worry but if you wear them outside be prepared to pick up every single small pebble on the ground you ever step on Despite being wide they look was still cool and they fit a little tight With my regular size Do not wear these for indoor basketball They slip and slide all over the place Good for looks only not function To begin Ill say I dont ever expect a running shoe in a basketball shoe but I did expect an added layer of comfort with what appeared as a substantial amount of boost foam In short its still a quality shoe but if youre expecting ultra boost comfort keep looking Its still a basketball shoe and it will still feel as such on your feet This is a awesome good looking pair of shoes The shoe fits as expected and they are comfortable except that the tongue is to thin at the top and when i tighten my shoelaces they cause pain where the the tongue doesnt protect right above the foot I dont have big feet by any measure but I found these shoes to be far too tight squishing my feet despite me ordering one size larger than my actual size I tried wearing them once and they gave me such cramps I had to return them These shoes were super tight when I first put them on then after walking around inside for a few hours they loosened up and became very comfortable I got these for dodgeball but they just look too clumpy and big and it just wast my style and the look just wasnt doing it for me Cuando los desenpaque los senti algo pesados pero ya puestos son bastantes livianos PedÃ\\xad los de talla 12 pero recomendarÃ\\xada pedir un talla y media mÃ¡s ya que los siento un poco apretados en lo ancho de largo quedan perfectos Super bequem das Leder drÃ¼ckt und schneidet nicht ein Die Sohle ist super flexibel wie die Schuhe von pepino  Meine Tochter hat einen hohen Spann und die passen supi Ich habe die Sandalen in schwarz noch bestellt Kann die Sandalen nur empfehlen Ich hoffe ich konnte helfen Tolles Materialtolle Verarbeitumg pour la maison au bout d une semaine le talon s est completement use et fendu tres mauvais produit OMG these deerskin moccasins are much nicer than I thought they would be They are soft deerskin leather inside and out No fake lining no rubber sole nothing but the real deal Comfort beyond belief These are for indoor use only do not expect to wear them outdoors for even a few stepsAs far as sizing they are generously cut as far as the length goes I typically buy size 11 or 12 shoes depending upon the brandstyle I bought these in size 11 They fit perfectly even with socks on So if you are â\\x80\\x9con the fenceâ\\x80\\x9d about two different sizes Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend going with the smaller of the two sizes that you typically buy in shoes Purchased a pair of black double deer mocs several months ago Aside from the top panels looking as though they were switched left to right the build quality seemed okay for a few months Wife told me they were leaving black marks on the damp floor after shed mop  So I then purchased a pair of the natural double deer  Wore those for a day and noticed a defect in the left insole like a void in the padding between the two soles  Sent in a request to Amazon for a replacement  Returned those and received the replacement a few days later  This pair has a weird anomaly with the insole of the right moc  Kicking myself now for returning the first pair before the replacement arrived  Between the two pairs I could have had one decent pair  Giving up at this point will wear them until they fall apart and just pretend that Im not bothered by the feel of the right one  Guess my expectations are just too high for a pair of 100 mocs  Ive had Minnetonka mocs most of my adult life and I dont remember ever experiencing these kinds of problems in the past Im wearing them as I type I mean Im NOT typing with moccasin glad tootsies cause that would be silly and I might pull a hammy I was given a pair of Minnetonka mocs many moons ago and I wore them like forever and a 12 Fast forward through the memory archive and I now have another pair On my feet Real nice too Size works for me and I like the little sticky patches you get while walking You know what I mean Its those areas where it fits a little tighter and keeps these bad boys secureFinal thoughts where I dont ramble looks like good quality stiching looks complete a little padding in the bottom something my EX might have said light weight and no aardvarks were harmed in their productionCheeriooooOOOooooOoooooOOoo I bought these for use inside my home I love them and am thinking to buy an extra pair because you never know when they will stop making them I got my brother a pair as well and he loves them too Im into high QUALITY SHOES OF ALL KINDS I also have a pair of LL Bean lined REAL shearling with leather and unlined all leather both are double sole slippers I love those as well but these are much softer due to the deer skin constructionThese can be worn out side in DRY weather summer time used for driving So you are from the house to car Car to house They are NOT for use walking outside all the time you will sear through the soles to quicklyIf you want some beautifully made indoors shoes that can be used in a limited way outside then these are for you Real leather especially Deer Skin is something you have to experience to understand and appreciateYou feet do not get nasty inside REAL leather shoes They do not start to stink unless you have nasty feet or problems to start with I had a pair of the LL Beans for 30 years They are VERY WELL MADE So are these Expensive but of the highest quality I ordered size 9 and returned them for 8 12 Which is still long enough that my toes dont hit the end I wear New Balance walking shoes in 8 12 4E the only company I know of that makes a shoe in that width Amazingly right out of the box these mocs were perfectly wide and had a very comfortable toe box  I went through no stretching period at all I must say I hesitated to pay what 80 Whatever Now I wouldnt send them back for twice what I paid I have only worn them inside If I dont go out in them on concrete and asphalt I figure Ill still be wearing them for at least ten years maybe twenty Ive even worn them to bed to keep my feet a tad warmer I have been telling myself for a good long time now that 15 slippers from the superstore were good enoughI have been lying to myself for too long now and that lying was going to stop ProntoA good long time ago I sold these moccasins Simple smooth double deerskin solesIt wasnt the simplicity of a cheap slipper that I have wanted No What I wanted was the simplicity of these quality MinnetonkasThe lies are over and a little piece of me that was askew was renewed What I wanted is what I got and what I got is worth every pennyI wear a size 115 shoe I bought a size 11 moccasin You will have no real idea of how your moccasins are going to fit during the first 24 hours of wearing them If you follow the simple rule of choosing a moccasin onehalf size below your normal shoe size you will be able to see how the leather and stitching are conforming to you foot during that first days useIf the moccasins are too tight or too loose then I have to ask you to reflect on the honesty with which you are reporting your shoe size Please understand that there is nothing wrong with having size 13EEE feet Please also understand it is not Minnetonkas fault if you are trying to put that size 13EEE into a size 11 moccasin and it doesnt fit or even falls apart It just isntThese moccasins have made me freeThe leather is supple the stitching is tight and a good complementary First size I ordered as per reviews was what I wear now When the mocassins came in there was a nick in the leather The mocassins were way too long Do I returned for a replacement with the next smaller size This set came in with one of rhe mocassins defective Stitching was coming apart And the mocassin was still too loose They do feel comfortable to the naked foot No arch support however If you need arch support these are not for you or like I will because I still like these an arch support insert can be added Hopefully this next time around they will fitI am very grateful that they take CS seriously and are replacing these without charging me I know that is expensive but I ordered as per instructions on the site Oldschool deerskin moccasins just like I remember from years ago Wellmade comfortable and I am guessing they will be very durable though its too soon to tell for sure  With a pair of cozy wool socks they are they perfect footwear for aroundthehouse fall and winter indoor wear  The leather soles are thick enough for a quick trip out the mailbox or trash can so long as it is not wet outside Note that they do run quite large I ordinarily wear somewhere between a 95 and a 105 depending on the shoe with the majority of shoes in my closet being a size 10 and I have a normalwidth foot The size 9 in these fits me quite well Light weight fit well I normally wear a USA 95 and have a wide foot Bets fit for shimano shoes seems to be a 44 for my wide feet Muy bonitos y de buena calidad Llegaron sÃºper rÃ¡pido We received the incorrect size and sent them back to exchange for the correct size I have sent several items back to Amazon and it has always been a smooth process As for the shoes I bought a pare for my 9 year old son who throws shot put and discuss He has a very flat wide foot and they fit him perfectly without having to get a wide size You want them to have a snug fit Like most beginners he started throwing in heavy lugged running shoes and had a difficult time turning his hips His PRâ\\x80\\x99s have gone up since buying the shoes because he can simply transfer power more effectively So if you have a beginning thrower these ASICS will boost their throws and confidence They are also affordable for a younger thrower that will eventually grow and need another pair at some point ASICS quality is also on point He has probably 1000 shot put throws and 1000 discus throws over the summer and hardly any wear on the shoe at all A superior allpurpose throwing shoe for the price  I only buy ASICS for throwing shoesdue to quality comfort and durability  My last pair of ASICS similar to this pair but higher end lasted 7 years and I only retired them due to my shot putter borrowing them and breaking his own school record and placing fifth in the State of Florida 1A  As is custom upon breaking a record the shoes were retired after the State of Florida Championship I am size 15 in the shoe fit perfectly Son likes Product ran very comparable to my sons shoe size The shoe it self is as expected The delivery was way faster than expected It said expect shipping in a couple of weeks It got to me in about 6 days Very happy Great throwing shoe Great fit very durable The shoe fits perfectly it is a great starter throwing shoe and definitely worth the money These Throws shoes fit true to size FÃ¤llt absolut grÃ¶Ã\\x9fengerecht aus Sehr schÃ¶nes Leder und tolle Farbe Super warm und absolut wasserdicht Wir pflegen sie mit Bienenwachs I know toddlers wear out

between a 9510 in show and I got her the 95 and they were perfect I have other Adidas size 8 12 I got the size 9 which I was expected to fit well but it is really tied Some reviews suggested getting a smaller size make me wonder if they are talking about the same shoes They look great and I am hoping to break them in for better fit My feet measure 9 14 and size 65 fits perfectly A bit stiff at first but after one afternoon of wearing were perfectly comfortable The shoe area at the top of ankle toprear of shoe bothered me dug into ankles at first but softened after first use not a problem at all anymore These shoes are designed for volleyball but I use them to play tennis  they are great Good fit good traction well produced Very comfortable overall  I feel safe making swift moves on tennis court i loved these shoesmy daughter plays volleyball and needed a supported shoe to weari would definately  consider these shoe to any volleyball mom Runs small VERY narrow across the heel and

prime Versand  finde ich okey QualitÃ¤t gut ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d They are sized accurately but keep in mind that your kid will be wearing thick soccer socks that can make their foot snug so you may want to go a half size up Exactly what we wanted My son loves his red cleats The are a bit narrow though My new alltime fave shoes for lifting I can really feel the difference in my connection with the ground The first week I wore these I PRd both my deadlift and my squat Maybe just my mindset on those days but I do believe the shoes helped Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not only perfect for digging into the floor on heavy lifts but theyâ\\x80\\x99re also super cute with shorts jeans leggings etc I love em I just absolutely love them Wish I could find my size in some of the other colors because I would definitely add more of these to my â\\x80\\x9cshoe collectionâ\\x80\\x9d  Some reviewers stated theyâ\\x80\\x99re like â\\x80\\x9cclown shoesâ\\x80\\x9d because of the wide toebox I do not find that to be the case but I do prefer a roomier toebox Love the low profile I loath thick soled sneakers The first few wears I did notice a tightness across the top of the foot where the seam is but my the third time I wore them they were broken in and are now my â\\x80\\x9cclose toedâ\\x80\\x9d shoe of choice I found the fit to be very true to size Love the color And LOVE that the laces stay tied throughout my entire workout I usually wear a 65 The other reviews said they ran small so I ordered 2 sizes up I ordered a 75 I could have used an 8 This is so far off that runs small doesnt capture the issue My toe is pressed to the end of the toe box and they are 2 sizes larger than normal I am glad I took other reviewers advice to order half a size up  Even so it fits quite narrow but the room in the toe area is just perfect not too much and not too little  I wouldnt order a whole size up though so half a size is good  These will help dig those heels on the ground during squats and deadlifts  I am a powerlifter and have been looking for these shoes for so long  Glad I found them now  I think these are more superior to Converse  Again the only reason why I am taking a star off is due to the narrow fitting but I guess thats how the shoes will keep your feet from moving Im sure I would love this shoe if it fit I sized up 12 size like everyone suggested and they are 12 size too large I am a true 85 in all brands and it seems this shoe is no exception If you feel you are solidly the same size across brands I do not recommend sizing upAlso only order prime Because the nonprimebutstillfreeshipping company makes you pay for the return shipping and a 15 restocking fee The fit is soooo narrow I have a wider foot but even if I didnâ\\x80\\x99t it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t fit because the seam by the toes fits right on the bone by your big toe and it is extremely painful to just put on The quality looks good but I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have a clue how they actually work because of the fit Returned them Mom loves these shoes but they will take a little time to break in They are so cute on A bad experience the shoe has only been worn for the second time the sole has fallen off and the shoe body is too hard It is very cute  my daughter loves it  Def order 12 size larger  I like to order more in diff color Product is great they run a little bit small so I suggest ordering a half size larger Love the sneakers Been using this for two years and still grippy The suede is a bit high in maintenance but the color is great Light weight great looking and perfect for casual work or play Didnt require any break in at all Felt good right out of the box The boots arrived just as I ordered them on time and they are very pretty love it  And the price excellent Always bought Clarkâ\\x80\\x99s unstructured shoes for comfort 40 cheaper than in store Great value Youâ\\x80\\x99ll enjoy them Perfect fit and feel right out of the box  Fit was consistent to size  Very comfortable soft sole  Works well in the office or with more casual attire  Ordered a second pair in a different color  Very pleased with the quality and function Stylish comfortable and quite versatile Cant go wrong with Clarks Si me quedÃ³ muy bien One of the most comfortable pair of shoes I own Love these boots nice boots but quite expensive Loved it Purple ones rock  My kid gets compliments wherever we go Loved them Produit de qualitÃ© trÃ¨s Moyenne La semelle suse plus rapidement  que dautres souliers Javais eu en gros rabais et mÃªme lÃ\\xa0 je ne rachÃ¨terais pas Quedan un poco mÃ¡s grandes estÃ¡n amplios y sÃºper cÃ³modos y ligeros Bought for my 10yr old son They fit great He has not complained Had them a few months and they are still intact My son loved the shoes they were comfortable and fit well The shoes laces are held in place by a piece of string and it broke a few days after we received them I contacted Amazon right away and they instructed me to contact Adidas for a refundexchange I submitted my request to Adidas on July 11 as requested by Adidas customer service When I didnt hear anything after a few weeks I emailed them again Several emails sent asking about an update went ignored I had to use the chat feature on the Adidas website to get an answer I was finally issued a return label and sent the shoes back and they were received on August 26 I followed up with customer service again and I was told I would receive an email update after 5 business days the time it takes to inspect the item and then the gift card would be issued within 7 business days This still has yet to happen When I contacted customer service again they now changed their story and said that because I didnt purchase the shoes directly from Adidas I would not receive my gift card until 20 business days after the shoes were received I am now being told that I wont receive my gift card until September 23 which is 2 12 months AFTER I submitted all of the required information to Adidas to start this process I will not be making any more purchases of Adidas products Bought these for my 10 year old He likes the sleek look of adidas but we wont buy these again Purchased midfebruary and by early May the soles were worn completely through in several places I dont mind spending more on name brand shoes because the quality usually matches the price but thats clearly not the case with these shoes Very disappointed in the Adidas brand Weve had 15 sneakers from Walmart last longer than this Waste of money These are very comfortable shoes but my son has gone through 3 pairs since April  Of course he grows out of them quickly so Iâ\\x80\\x99m replacing them anyway but every pair has literally been falling apart after only a few months  It would be nice if they could at least be used for playyard shoes but they arenâ\\x80\\x99t even in good enough shape for that  We are going back to buying Nikes Very nice presentation The box was in amazing conditionmost of the time theyre all torn apart and damaged so bravo on that part ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8fSizing was good My son is a 10105 and these are 11 They fit him with room to grow They look sharp Definitely legit Theyre made in Indonesia Usually thats a sign theyre authentic Very good One happy mama I will update maybe in a few months to tell about the wear My son has only worn these for six days and they are literally falling apart He loves the fit and how light they are but itâ\\x80\\x99s very disappointing that they look like this after less than a week I needed some running shoes for my son quickly when he told me he signed up for track Looked a some Nikes that were so soft theyd shred in no time as Nikes do checked out some Under Armortoo clunky and heavy Found these and they are pretty durable They have a knitted top and light foam sole perfect for my kid Hes rough on his stuff so these are perfect These are pretty light for running or just play I definitely recommend giving this pair a try So glad I bought these My son is the pickiest about his shoes I let him pick these ones out after refusing the other ones I bought They came 2 days earlier than expected and once they arrived I realized they donâ\\x80\\x99t have a tongue which is sweet Itâ\\x80\\x99s easier for him to put on but looks and feels like a normal sneaker I am very happy Canâ\\x80\\x99t beat 30 for a name brand shoe that appeases my child â\\x98ºï¸\\x8f Comprei uma antes que ficou muito grande 2930 precisei devolver para pedir um numero menor e ficou perfeita Escolhemos a verde e achamos muito

foto Vestono bene 5 stelle Ein sehr leichter Schuh flexible Sohle und sieht auch fein aus Mein Sohn mag ihn sehr gerne tragen Sein Lieblingsschuh egal ob Schnee oder Regen Molto belle e di ottima fattura I was so excited for these shoes for my son that I disregarded all of the negative reviews But now I am stuck with the shoe that my son cannot wear because he literally tripped and fell out of the shoes because the strap is too short I even sewed an extension on the strap to help make it longer and the velcro that is attached to the shoe is very weak So here I am stuck with very expensive shoes for my 5yearold that I spent a lot of money on please do not purchase these you will definitely be disappointed My kid love it  Love these but the strap across the top is so short it comes undone immediately Very frustrating Not sure what they were thinking with this And it isnâ\\x80\\x99t just this one pair I ordered my daughter the same pair in a different color and size and have the same issue My son loved the shoes very vibrant color very good looking very comfortable Would be a great shoe if not the design defect in velcro that keeps the shoe attached to the kid  The receiving part of velcro is just about half an inch in length  there is no way its enough for a kid who is running around 247  as soon as he starts running the velcro detaches and shoes become useless I hope Adidas fixes that defect in otherwise wonderful shoe Zapatilla demasiado grande comprÃ© talla 6 big kids para mi sobrina de 12 aÃ±os y le quedo enorme al probarlas me ha quedado a mi soy talla en

keinen starken Halt dafÃ¼r sind sie zu instabil Ansonsten sehr schÃ¶n und angenehm zu tragen Super Golfschuh fÃ¼r den Sommer luftig leicht sehr angenehm zu tragen Se ajustan a lo que buscaba SchÃ¶ner Sommergolfschuh I use them on the golf course Sehr leicht und komfortabel Zum Golfspielen TrÃ¨s jolie pour une tenue de golf comme une robe ou jupe I live in Florida and play yearround  The shoes have held up well through two years of wear  Im not too fond of the latest trend of wearing sandals for golf preferring instead to have my feet shod while playing never know when you might run into some unfriendly red ant  And best of all they clean up nicely  Just drop them into the washer and set them on a stand to dry I e been wearing this golf shoes for years and love them We spend our winters in Az where it can be really hot and the mesh is light and airy My feet donâ\\x80\\x99t feel like they are on fireâ\\x80\\x99 Nearly impossible to get on their feet  If I get a size that will slide on then they are too loose on the actual foot  Bizarre design These are good simple indoor shoes My son wears them on the court and sand turf and has no problems with them My son loves his indoor shoe My performance increased Scorning more goals than ever This indoor shoe is a good buy and has held of great for this winter season Exelentes muy cÃ³modos el pie respira atravez del material los compre coml un regalo para mi esposa y le encantaron al principio pensamos que el material se aflojaria con el uso diario pero por el contrario es muy resistente y no se deforma love that Skechers offer so many stylish sneakers and shoes in wide width  these are so comfortable like wearing ankle socks with a sole  the toe box is super roomy and I think it would be roomy even in regularmedium width  the fabric of the shoe allows for even more toe movement good for me because I dont like constricting footwear  for knockabout runningerrands footwear you wont find anything much more comfortable than this hence the 5star rating  for serious walking or standing though these will be lacking in arch support  and Id make sure to stay on flat even terrain because the fabric doesnt provide much structure  I could see stepping wrong and someones foot sliding right off the sole easily causing a twisted ankle or fall  but for what theyre meant for theyre awesome  my new fave shoes The inside of the shoes say Ultra sock and that is what I would call them A built in sock look Very comfy I was able to get an Amazon Warehouse deal and get them for 20 I am in love with Skechers wide with shoes I have a hard time with shoes due to having a wide foot and needing something comfortable but stylish for a 30 something mom I was previously buying cute Crocs brand but they only have so many styles that arent sandals Plus they arent cheap on Amazon and theres no store near me retailers but not a full Crocs store So if I order online and dont like them I was stuck unless I wanted to pay return shipping Free Amazon returns great shoes Makes me happy Not enough backheel support Foot slides right out back I returned these although I had a bit of a fiasco with that as had ordered a few pair of shoes and sent these to wrong place and place sent them to acted like did not have so ended up having to pay for these A bit frustrating luckily werenâ\\x80\\x99t too costly but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not inclined to try out shoes so much now These shoes are fantastic My feet swell in the summer heat and it is painful to wear shoes These Skechers are in a wide size allowing for my swelling They are super soft and light weight I am going to buy another pair in a different color Love this shoe  Got several pairs in different colors  Try to buy a couple of new pair every year because I wear them everyday My last 6 pairs of sneakers have been Sketchers  I wear them out at the little toe where they push the material apart  I like the way they feel with the memory foam Well have to see how long these Bounder last at the toe  Most others last 6 to 12 months The shoes looked good and were what I ordered Though I got the same size as the ones I had been wearing these are very tight Seems to run about a 12 size smaller than usual Other than that I got what I expected Fit great the memory cushion is nice and gives you plenty of support Going to buy a second pair asap I bought these 6 months ago overall it is good product but If someone wants to wear it for work and stands for 8 to 10 hours it doesnt help that much Huh These are genuinely ugly They are not bad Just it I have perfect fot the same size another model skechers and adidas shoes but these model a little bit small Quality for sure not the best very light and cozy Can never go wrong with the Skechers memory foam shoe Ein schÃ¶ner leichter Stiefel Hatte ihn in GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 20 bestellt Leider sind Stiefel zum hineinschlÃ¼pfen nichts fÃ¼r unser Enkelkind Sie bleibt im Schaft hÃ¤ngen Wie immer alles perfekt bei Amazon I have used Tevas since the 90s but when my last pair died I decided to get something that looked a bit less dad sandal despite now being a father  Id heard good things about Chaco sandals from multiple sources and decided to take the plunge  Sizing charts are accurate although I found them confusing  Best thing to do is figure out your shoe size in either centimetres or European sizing and backtrack form there  Im normally a size 9 in shoes but got the size 7 Chaco per the size chart and it fits perfectThings Ive noticed  The straps are MUCH softer and flexible than Tevas even on the parts that arent using Velcro  My feet appreciate that  The sole has strong and definite arch support so if you have flat feet these might not be for you  Its also a very wide last which is good for my hobbit feet but wouldnt work well if yours were long and narrow  The foot bed is also very stiff compared to a Teva sandal which I assume means they will last a long time but also take a few days to break in properlyFor me they fit well and are very comfy to wear  Im happy with the style of them as well  I took a point off because I think they are a tad overpriced in Candada especially with the import fees being tacked on  If I were in the US Id happily pay the amounts being asked

We are big fans of chacos  This pair seems fine but in previous pairs the strap around ankle did not hang down so long  once the shoe is secured at ankle there are at least 3 inches of extra that almost drag the groundnot sure why this change in design  There are videos online of how to tuck up the strap but it seems like a design flaw compared to last models I received my 1st pair with the straps much to small to fit my feet but I could not adjust the straps at all like the straps were glued into position  I returned the 1st pair asking for a replacement  The replacement had the same problem the straps could not be adjusted  When I returned the 2nd pair I was charged an 1842 restocking fee despite that they were listed as FREE Returns Really good sandals I loved that I could just slide them on and start wearing them without having to break them in There was maybe a slight hassle to adjust the straps after purchase to fit my feet but otherwise nothing too complicated Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gone hiking and biking in them and havenâ\\x80\\x99t been disappointed with the soles or straps The only thing I have to say against them is that constant wear is abrasive to the skin especially the toe straps I havenâ\\x80\\x99t gotten any blisters Iâ\\x80\\x99m not really prone to them but they do leave marks that only go away after a couple of days of not wearing them Otherwise I love them Awesome traction even when wet I ordered 3 different sandals from different companies and as soon as I tried these on trying on the other 2 was just a formality I love the strap design and the high arch my feet needed it and the overall build quality is inline with the price Great buy Too small for top of foot If the straps would move through the loops at ankle we could have adjusted the foot area but it was sewn Love the sandals but a little heavier than I would have liked so I donâ\\x80\\x99t use them for backpacking as I had originally intended  They are still awesome for using around home I was a little concerned that these would run a little small I usually buy size 10 but opted for 9 this time because Ive always had the impression Chacos run a little small Happy to report thats not the case These also seem to have a lighter less clunky solebase material which I was not expecting but really really like Well see how these new ones hold up to the daily grind Have owned many pairs of this shoe usually very durable  The shoes no longer come with Vibram soles and after only a month and a half of normal use the sole is already delaminating from the shoe  Unacceptable for this price Toller Schuh am Schaft recht eng  Eine Leggings passt rein Matschhose wird zu eng sein FÃ¼r uns wichtig er hÃ¤lt am Bein  FÃ¤llt bei 2021 grÃ¶Ã\\x9fenmÃ¤ssig wie eine 21 aus Tut was ein

es nichts zu meckernSind wasserdicht und mein 14 Monate alter Sohn kann sehr gut drin laufen Bellissimi Sehr schÃ¶ne Schuhe Spitze Ma fille na pas pu les mettre car trop petits mais conforme Ã\\xa0 la description I like the design Dont feel very comfortable  they fit perfect and look perfect other than the fact that it looks like they had previously been worn a couple of dirt marks on it but overall theyâ\\x80\\x99re still good shoes Loved them A little too big tho Incomodas I spent a lot of my childhood barefoot and have struggled for years to find shoes that fit my wide toes very narrow heel feetThey offer NO arch support which isnâ\\x80\\x99t a problem for me but could be for others My shoes fit perfectly and Iâ\\x80\\x99m even sure I could add an insole if I wantedI mainly purchased these as gym shoes that have some sort of toe grip for certain exercises but Iâ\\x80\\x99m excited to try them out in the summer time in the river too Was a great fit for wide feet  Will not accomodate too well socks unless they are super thinI will buy them again Seems these are made with less care then I would have hoped for There is glue clearly used to put the shoe together  that has not been cleaned up at all And they are too tight to wear I hope they loosen up with use size is true Very comfortable beautiful purple color I do like this shoe very comfortable My son loves them he thinks he can run faster with these on They fit great  seem durable and comfortable Look great too Great shoes my son love it Comodidad Great shoe arrived quite late but product is good Bought these for my daughter who absolutely loves them She is a picky person when it comes to shoes because she has a wide foot which can be hard to find a good looking great fitting shoe They are perfect for her and she said she never wants to take them off so in all I  am glad I bought them Quality These do not seem like authentic adidas They have a very strange look in person I do not like them at all and nor does my childFit I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend ordering these but if you do make sure your kiddo has a narrow foot and order a half size up at least My daughter really likes these shoes and does everything in them Its just unfortunate that the shiny stripes started peeling off within the first week of wear Now 3 are peeling off and flapping around and it just looks really sloppy as though shes been wearing them for a couple years instead of a couple months My mom got so concerned seeing the state of her shoes a couple weeks ago that shes ordering her another pair ð\\x9f¤£ But other than making me look like a negligent mom theyre comfortable and lightweight and cute Great looking shoe  I love the look of these on my son  As boys do though he is pretty rough on clothes and shoes  The fabric that covers the top of the toes looks like of like mesh got a couple of small holes in it after a couple of months and now after 34 months of wearing them the entire piece of fabric on the top of the shoe is basically flapping in the breeze its pulled back so far  The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok so I guess more of a cosmetic issue but still annoying  Not sure Id buy these again simply because of that but I did love them for the first couple of months I thought adidas would offer a quality material but my 6 year old son already was able to wear it out the tip of the shoes within two months All he has been doing with the shoes is walking running biking  playing in recess outside in school He does not play soccer so kicking or something like that is not the reason why the fronts torn out Looked great to start but after a few short weeks the front plastic toe started to crack open Typical daily use Would not recommend this product Meravigliose

labels of any kind either on the shoes or box I highly doubt these are genuine And yes they were from Amazon not a third party seller These shoes were comfortable right away I usually wear a heavier

Love them this is my first pair and already shopping for another if your looking for a lot of arch support there really is not a lot but I find these very comfy and true to size got a lot of compliments on them  just my first wearing You can wear them all day very comfy Love these casual shoes My daughter loves these They were true to size and decent for the price Would buy more She also gets compliments every time she wears them looked great love the color will order more These were stiff when I first got them but they have broke in some Absolutely in love with my sunflower shoes They are perfect ð\\x9f\\x8c» Son lindos pero son demasiado grandes si pedÃ\\xad mi talla pero igual estÃ¡n muy grandes Cute and comfy but they do run big The shoes would be awesome if they werent so huge I got my regular size but theyre way too big Tried them on and they were roomy so I wanted to wear them to see how theyd work out but I cant wear them because my feet slide around Super disappointed theyre super cute LOVE THESE SHOES Beautiful shoe but too narrowEdit I ended up keeping them and donating to a neighborhood kid My son loved them so much he wore them everywhere Too bad they donâ\\x80\\x99t last as long  but it could be that he did overuse them  True to size great quality laces are not too short and not too long My son said theyâ\\x80\\x99re comfy Shoes seemed nice but my son has wide feet and these did not work  Some adidas shoes run wide but these did not My 9 year old son uses these for indoor soccer and loves them my son loved themgreat fit They fit perfectly Muy bueno pero muy frande PERFECTO TAL CUAL LO ESPERABAMOS So comfy reinschlÃ¼pfen und loslaufen Bequem wie erwartet Andere Schuhe mÃ¼ssen oft eingelaufen werden war bei diesem Paar nicht erforderlich Excellent produit Ã\\xa0 enfiler et trÃ¨s confortables Son muy cÃ³modos Los utilizo para trabajar en especial en las guardias I purchased this pair because I wanted another sneaker from Ecco but I wanted something that was a slipon with a less traditional style than the laceup sneaker of which I have 5 pair from Ecco in various colors and this fit the bill  As with all Eccos I can fit my custom orthotic inside with ease and somehow it does not compromise the fit of the shoe whatsoever I wear a half orthotic which only supports the heel and arch of my foot and does not go to the toe  The arch support without the orthotic is fair on its own and the bottom is more flexible than the other Ecco sneakers that I have but I expected that with the style of this shoe and was what I wanted  The sole of this shoe is not rigid so if you need that this will not provide that for you  It is an extremely light shoe and breathable which is perfect for the warmer months  Lately these are the pair that I grab the most and get a lot of compliments on them Theyâ\\x80\\x99re different than the average sneaker They are sleeker and extremely comfortable and work with a lot of outfits obviously more casual looks but I did wear them with skorts and cute top on vacation recently and they were perfect  Also great at airports when you need to slip your shoes off when going through security and super comfortable when youâ\\x80\\x99re just sitting in your seat for hours on the plane ride and really light to pack  Highly recommend I got these to wear at work  Im in medical and live in scrubs  Im on my feet all day  These are so comfy and adorable  I get so many compliments on them   I wear a 75 and I ordered a 38  Fits PERFECT I like Ecco shoes  I have a couple of pairs  I was looking for something to slip in and out easily for work with arch support  These fit the image but they scratched the top of my foot  There is no inner lining so everything feels rough  Had to return Not like other pairs of Ecco I have  too short Also even though my instep is almost non existent it was too tight around my foot to the point when it becomes painful after a couple of minutes just having them on Sent them back Liked the style and color  I tend to need a narrow heel with a medium width foot bed  Ecco usually works for me but this shoe slipped in the heel and I had to return them  They ran wider than usual Super comfy for doing a lot of walking in the airport and travels A snug fit to put on but didnt slip on my narrow heel Plenty of room in the toe box Ive had it for just a few months and its starting to wear The other ecco shoes I have keep going for years Im new to the world of variable sized shoes but these feel great for walking around the house and even a little basketball  Regarding sizefit order wider than your usual  I am slow to criticize on fit since I am just figuring out variable sized footwear  But even compared to other Propet footwear this one is much narrower  The photo is two right Propet shoes both size 14 and width 5E  Note that the strap of the black shoe completely covers the Velcro but the grey sneaker was close to not being wide enough with about an inch of Velcro showing  So far its holding with less Velcro contact  I hope so since thats their widest width and these feel great The tongues have a lot of loose threads on both shoes Its really comfy otherwise and breathes extremely well I dont like seeing so many loose threads though It makes me wonder how many other spots that I havent or cant see have sewing problems too Its a shame because its very comfy otherwise I purchased these for my brother who lives in a nursing home We both loved the looks of the shoes and the fit was right on target I returned them because when he tried them on I saw the soles seemed to stick to the carpet a bit I was afraid hed fall which he is already inclined to do because he doesnt pick up his feet well There were other shoes I ordered which did not exhibit this problem I bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them Good fit good stability excellent qualityWould definitely recommend I bought this pair for the gym Its very difficult to tighten the shoe enough that I wont step out of it while working out If you have young healthy feet this product may be for you I have wide worn down feet and this shoe has zero support It is easy to operate but the padding is less then effective I liked the way that the shoe fit I have always had problems with wide feet They are my go to shoes for outside and to the gym however after two months of usage and outside of the return policy the sides of the shoes are pulling apart I would not buy them again bought these late in season may be wrong choice fo winter  I was hesitant to purchase these sneakers for my son because I was unfamiliar with the brand However my son loves the fit comfort and style They worked out well for a work environment that eats shoes held out longer than several other Shoes Ive tried They wore out after 5 months but thats at 6 days a week in a warehouse job for 10 hours a day Not bad when they went on sale for around 45 Super schÃ¶ner Schuh Meine Kleine liebt ihnWir werden ihn wieder kaufen FÃ¼r zierliche FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe geeignet Sehr hochwertig verarbeitet Wir nutzen ihn auch als Ballerina fÃ¼r auÃ\\x9fenMeine 2 JÃ¤hrige schaft es prima sie selbstÃ¤ndig an und auszuziehen Sehr schÃ¶ne Schuhe in bewehrter QualitÃ¤t Sie passen wie erwartet sind gut verarbeitet und rutschfest Meine Tochter kann sie mit dem Klettverschluss selbst anziehen und trÃ¤gt sie sehr gerne Die SchÃ¼hchen kÃ¶nnen nicht nur als Hausschuhe getragen werden Sie sind sehr leicht die Sohle flexibel aber fÃ¼r schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe geeignet Not only are they very stylish and chic theyre also wellbuilt sturdy and very easy to clean Not the cheapest slippers but they are definitely worth every penny ZuckersÃ¼Ã\\x9fe Hausschuhe nur haben sich nach nur zweimaligem Tragen die kleinen applizierten BlÃ¼mchen abgelÃ¶st Sehr schade fÃ¼r Schuhe mit diesem Preis Tolle Sommerhausschuhe QualitÃ¤t und GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe wie gewohnt von Living KitzbÃ¼hel Absolute Kaufempfehlung If youre at all familiar with the Clarks reputation for comfortable shoes then there is really no need to read any reviews as Clarks are always a good decision and this pair of shoes is no different I can wear these shoes for hours without my foot feeling any pain and theyre breathable enough to prevent the shoe from getting too hot inside and creating an atmosphere in which odors can fester The shoes look just as they do in the pictures so theres no surprises there either Sneaker is comfortable and looks good Shoelaces come untied easily These things are noises It makes a squishing noise as I walk They are expensive for what you get You could buy almost 3 pairs of Sketchers for this price Hermosos The product is genuine and exactly as described  happy with it just hope the size chart to have more options for British sizes Pair is little bigger I would like to return this pair and I want to get in size10 ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8d liked it Los zapatos son para mi bebÃ© de casi 2 aÃ±os pero los comprÃ© un poco mÃ¡s grandes ya que conseguÃ\\xad una super oferta por Amazon Los zapatos son originales y fueron enviados desde Estados Unidos No tuve que pagar tax ni ningÃºn impuesto al llegar a MÃ©xico pues ya venÃ\\xadan incluidos en el precio Una real oferta pues no pague mÃ¡s de 400 pesos por los zapatos originales cuando en la tienda New Balance no bajan de 1000 pesos  Excelente calidad y materiales  Se los guardo hasta que ya le queden sin embargo soy feliz Calidad insuperable fÃ¡ciles de limpiar y el material es muy resistente contra agua la verdad son mis favoritos El precio inigualable PÃ©simo se supone que son hechos para que tengan buena resistencia y por eso los compre Pero desafortunadamente no duraron ni 6 meses y eso que solo fueron usados en casa Ni siquiera para ir al parque al algo similar Super buen preciocalidad Mi hijo no se los quita estÃ¡n muy cÃ³modos y no se ensucian tan fÃ¡cil A buen precio puesto en Mexico El producto es de calidad se ven geniales Le encantaron a mi hijo En general estÃ¡n bien siento que la suela se resbala un poco y no son muy acolchonados por dentro El color estÃ¡ increÃ\\xadble y llegaron al tiempo que indicaron Estan muy bonitos y quedaron super bien Muy emocionado y contento quedÃ³ al niÃ±o  Gracias ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 Me gustaron mucho son muy bonitos y de excelente calidad Pero hablando de comodidad no son cÃ³modos realmente El modelo diseÃ±o y comodidad son excelentes solo la tela del teni se debe tener los cuidados necesarios ya que estÃ¡n algo frÃ¡giles Al ser calzado Americano suele venir un poco mas amplio el diseÃ±o es padre y el tiempo de entrega genial Muy cÃ³modos pero deberÃ\\xadan poner numeraciÃ³n en cm Excelentes Me encantaron Son verdaderamente bellos Iâ\\x80\\x99m a 65 narrow I bought these because I needed a snicker that could hold my ankle while working out after an injury Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not the shoe for that The high top style is really for style there is no ankle hold I was also struggling a lot to get my foot in and outLooks really cute itâ\\x80\\x99s light weight but I had to send it back it was too much of a hassle and did not fit my purpose I love puma shoes It is basically all I wear But very disappointed when my shoes arrived and I opened to see them with stains on them and look as if they been worn prior to sending And itâ\\x80\\x99s a real hassle to return right now during all this stuff going on I fe like I just got swindled out of my money Comfortable cute lightweight and true to size Personally love these I use them to workout and not outside just because I donâ\\x80\\x99t wanna get them dirty Love these shoes Purchased these for more ankle support when working out They provide great support overall a firm sole while not being so stiff that itâ\\x80\\x99s uncomfortable Ive had the older version of these for years and theyve served me well I bought these and didnt bother breaking them in this winter because I found them narrow even though they said wide Ill work on breaking them in though and hope they do me for years like the older ones Me gusta mucho el zapato columbia protege mucho mis pies no me cansa  este modelo en especial viene un poco mÃ¡s amplio de lo normal manejo 75 en mis compras  sin embargo me lo quedÃ© solo uso un calcetÃ\\xadn mÃ¡s gruesoel color es combinable con mucha ropa lo uso para andar en la ciudad Recomendable I love this shoe Very very comfortable Im between 95 and 10 I took size 10 M and its perfect for a foot that isnt wide Solid yet flexible SÃºper bonitos para usarse hasta para ir al sÃºper me dolÃ\\xada la rodilla y el dolor se fue cuando me puse los tenis del diario en lugar de sandalias los recomendÃ³ Great shoes look just like picture I ordered half size up for socks Fit perfectly seem like a great quality product Super happy Love these shoes  I have wide feet and theyâ\\x80\\x99re super comfy  I probably could have got the 85s but with socks the 9s are great  They feel great on heavy duty but comfortable Todo bien con la compra Zapato rÃ\\xadgido tal y como debe ser Like that it is water proof Great for walking on both smooth and rougher pathways Also used them for golf  great traction Cumplieron su objetivo hice senderismo en un bosque lluvioso y tuvieron buen agarre a pesar de que no son waterproof soportaron bien la lluvia y el lodo Ich liebe die Schuhe Sehr gutes laufgefÃ¼hl halten sogar etwas warm gut gepolzterte einlegesohle schon drin Material FÃ¤rbt nicht ab bis 150kg super gut belastbar auch zum joggen geeignet Ich habe mir gedacht dass diese Schuhe eine gute DÃ¤mpfung haben mÃ¼ssten und habe mich deshalb fÃ¼r sie entschieden Ein anderes Modellsprach mich zwar mehr an war in meiner GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe aber nicht mehr zu bekommen Sie sind ganz fix gekommen ohne viel unnÃ¶tige Verpackung und haben nicht auffÃ¤llig gerochen Normale Passform und mit Sneaker oder Socken super zu tragen reinzwÃ¤ngeln muss ich mich auch nichtSchuhlÃ¶ffel reicht vorne Ã¼ber dem Spann richtenhochziehen und los gehts Habe sie einen Vormittag im Haus getragen und mittags dann wegen warmer FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe ausgezogen Ich empfand sie als angenehm nicht zu locker und die DÃ¤mpfung war so wie ich sie mir vorgestellt habeIch habe Probleme mit den Gelenken und deshalb diese dicken Sohlen WÃ¤ren sie als Schietwetterschuhe zu bekommen fÃ¼r HundespaziergÃ¤nge wÃ¼rde ich mich freuen Meine Tochter sucht sich bereits welche fÃ¼r die Kita als Hausschuhe ausWenn Sie jetzt noch gut halten dann war das die absolut richtige WahlfÃ¼r mich Am Schuh ansich gibts nicht zu meckern Allerdings wÃ¼rde ich beim nÃ¤chsten Kauf eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellen Trage eine normale 38 jedoch durch dich Machart und ohne SchnÃ¼rung zieht sich der Schuh sehr schwer an Ist man erstmal drin sitz er gut aber doch eine Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer Trotzdem bin ich mit dem Schuh zufrieden An sich bestimmt ein toller Schuh wenn man nicht gerade angeschwollene 9MonatsSchwangerschaftsfÃ¼Ã\\x9fe hatHabe die Schuhe geholt da ich gerade bei dem aktuellen Wetter rutschfeste Schuhe brauche in die man auch aufgrund des mittlerweile dicken Bauch einfach rein schlÃ¼pfen kannLeider empfand ich die Artikelbeschreibung als etwas irrefÃ¼hrend da ich davon ausging dass der gesamte FuÃ\\x9f aus elastischem Material bestehen und sich somit dem FuÃ\\x9f anpassen wÃ¼rde Da ich ziemliche Wassereinlagerungen in den BeinenFÃ¼Ã\\x9fen  habe und nur der Eingang elastisch ist kam ich jedoch nicht mal ansatzweise in den Schuh hinein weswegen er zurÃ¼ck gehen wirdSchade rutschfest und bequem wirkte er dennoch Wirklich schÃ¶ne Schuhe preisgÃ¼nstig und sehen gut verarbeitet aus Aber und jetzt kommt das ABER Ich hab wirklich keine sonderlich breiten FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe Eher normal Mir passen sonst alle Schuhe aber diese hier waren viel zu eng Nicht nach vorne hin sondern an den Seiten Nach 1h tragen hatte ich unglaubliche FuÃ\\x9fschmerzen bekommen weil durchgehend ein starker Druck von den Seiten herrschte Schade ich habe mich nÃ¤mlich Anfangs sehr gefreut weil die Schuhe klasse aussehenHabe die Schuhe heute schweren Herzen Retour geschicktUpdate Retour und Erstattung gingen Problemlos und sehr schnell Ã¼ber die BÃ¼hne Ich hÃ¤tte doch eine halbe Nummer grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer bestellen sollen Ich brauchte die Schuhe dringend sodass ich fÃ¼r den Umtausch etc keine Geduld hatteDa sie ja aus Stoff sind haben sie sich noch etwas geweitet somit sind sie jetzt sehr bequem Ich laufe sehr viel damit verwende sie allerdings zum Gassi gehen und nicht zum joggenWÃ¼rde sie wieder kaufen Von der GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe her passt es sehr gut leider ist der Schuh nur fÃ¼r schmale FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe geeignet Werde also warten bis mein sohn die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe erreicht hat und sie ihm dann geben fÃ¼r mich persÃ¶nlich nicht das wahre Wenn man von der enge absieht steht man sehr gut darin und kann auch super laufen Die Schuhe sind genialIch habe schon Ã¤hnliche von Skechersdie aber nicht so gut passen wie dieseAbsolut empfehlenswertDie Sohle ist ganz weich und die Schuhe bequemPreisLeistung ist topFÃ¼r Skechers Schuhe bezahlt man locker das doppelteIch habe die Schuhe jetzt knapp drei Monate je nach Wetterlage in Gebrauch und ich muss sagen QualitÃ¤t ist superEs muss nicht immer nur ein Markenprodukt sein Die QualitÃ¤t und Verarbeitung der Schuhe scheint in Ordnung zu sein Auch optisch gefÃ¤llt er mirEr ist schmal geschnitten und leider fÃ¤llt die GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe etwas knapp aus ein halbe GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe mehr wÃ¤re toll Allerdings weiÃ\\x9f ich noch nicht wie sich der Schuh nach lÃ¤ngerem Tragen verhÃ¤ltdas Obermaterial ist aus nachgibigem gestrickten Stoff Wird nach lÃ¤ngerem Tragen das Material  nachgebenschreibe spÃ¤ter nochmal eine Anmerkung dazuLeider musste ich die Schuhe zurÃ¼ck senden da sie doch zu klein und schmal sind Der Schuh ist super bequem und leicht Durch die Puffersohle sehr RÃ¼cken und HÃ¼ftfreundlichWas mir nicht gefÃ¤llt ist das er vorne an der Zehenkuppe ausbeult Die Rundung kÃ¶nnte etwas stabiler sein so dass  diese nicht aus ihrer Form gerÃ¤t Beim Tragen entstehen unschÃ¶ne Dellen Ich stopfe sie nach dem Tragen immer mit Zeitungspapier aus damit die Dellen nicht bleiben und um die Rundung wieder schÃ¶n zu machenDaher 1 Punkt Abzug Auf diese Hausschuhe bin ich aufgrund einer Empfehlung gestoÃ\\x9fen Zu Beginn hat mich der recht hohe Preis fÃ¼r Kinderhausschuhe doch etwas abgeschreckt aber ich bereue den Kauf auf keinen Fall Eher im Gegenteil Nachdem ich diese Schuhe meinem Sohn angezogen habe und eine Woche ihn damit beobachtet habe kann ich diese Hausschuhe zu 100 weiterempfehlen Mit der rutschfesten Sohle die super flexibel ist fÃ¼hlt sich der Schuhe wie ein BarfuÃ\\x9fschuh an und auch die QualitÃ¤t des gesamten Schuhs hat uns sehr Ã¼berzeugt Der Schuhe ist sogar fÃ¼r breite FÃ¼Ã\\x9fe gut geeignet Bei uns werden definitiv nur noch Nanga Hausschuhe einziehen Komplett flexible Sohle und sehr gute Breite definitiv als BarfuÃ\\x9fHausschuhe zu bezeichnen Die Sohle ist abwaschbar und gibt einen rutschfesten Halt Der Schuh ist sowieso bei 30 Grad waschbar Aus Biobaumwolle und Naturkautschuk Das Gangbild war sofort perfekt und wer mit den neuen Hausschuhen gleich losflitzen kann hat die richtigen Schuhe Der Preis ist angemessen Supertolle Hausschuhe wie ich finde Barfussschuhe sozusagen  sehr weiche und dÃ¼nne Sohle rutschfest aber ohne Profil und ohne Fussbett so dass die KinderfÃ¼sse natÃ¼rlich gehen kÃ¶nnen und so eigentlich ein Barfussfeeling fÃ¼r den Fuss entsteht und die Koordination und Bewegungsentwicklung frei und natÃ¼rlich stattfinden kann trotzdem sind sie geschÃ¼tzt und gewÃ¤rmt Ist schon unsere vierte GrÃ¶sse glaube ich Kaufe nur die bin sehr Ã¼berzeugt und zufrieden Erst einmal muss man sagen lt Testberichte sollen diese Schuhe ohne Chemie auskommen Das kann mein Geruchstest nur bestÃ¤tigen FÃ¼hlen sich gut an und sind leicht Jetzt kommt das ABER Was ich schade finde wir hÃ¤tten sie gern behaltenIn der LÃ¤nge fallen sie etwas grÃ¶Ã\\x9fer aus leider ist der Spann zu eng Der Gummizug ist nicht flexibel genug Das ist wirklich Ã¤rgerlich Hier sollte nachgebessert werden Dann ist es ein Top Schuh Wir hatten noch nie Hausschuhe die nach kurzem unregelmÃ¤Ã\\x9figem Tragen so ausgesehen haben nicht mal um ein vielfaches gÃ¼nstigere Ich habe beim 1 Mangelpaar Ersatz angefordert und das Ersatzpaar sieht jetzt so aus also habe ich jedenfalls kein Montagsprodukt erwischt Ich kann die guten Rezensionen Ã¼berhaupt nicht nachvollziehen bei uns ist Nanga unten durch Le pantofole sono carine ma non sono adatte al piede del mio bimbo l elastico sul collo del piede gli stringeva troppo Ma il servizio clienti Amazon Ã¨ stato perfetto le ho mandate indietro e mi hanno restituito i soldi Con Nanga vado sul sicuro in piÃ¹ le ho trovate ad un prezzo davvero stracciato Sono ottime per i piedini dei bimbi perchÃ¨ hanno la suola impermeabile ed isolata dal pavimento ma ultraflessibile Assolutamente identiche a pantofone similari della concorrenza che costano ben di piÃ¹ Mio figlio appena indossate ha esordito con â\\x80\\x9csono comodissime Mammaâ\\x80\\x9d Ottimo acquisto sia come qualitÃ¡ che come modello Un poâ\\x80\\x99 strette da infilare ma una volta indossate il bambino puÃ² giocare liberamente Io le ho comprate per lâ\\x80\\x99asilo e le consiglio vivamente Habe den Schuh in GrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe 22 fÃ¼r meine Tochter bestellt Obwohl er grundsÃ¤tzlich vorne gut passt und sie noch etwas Luft hat ist er durch den unverstellbaren Gummizug wahnsinnig eng obwohl sie keinen breiten FuÃ\\x9f hat Man kommt so kaum in den Schuh hinein und er muss dadurch unbequem sein denn er wird meist direkt wieder ausgezogen Schade denn laut aktuellen Testberichten enthÃ¤lt er keine bedenklichen RÃ¼ckstÃ¤nde Werde vielleicht einen anderen Schuh dieser Marke versuchen  der ein Riemchen hat und nicht dieses feste Gummiband Die Hausschuhe sind ein echter Hinguckervon guter QualitÃ¤t und halten gut am relativ schmalen FuÃ\\x9f unseres Sohnes Der Schuh ist bei uns seit 25 Monaten im Kindergarten in Gebrauch bis jetzt sind keine Abnutzungserscheinungen aufgetreten Son hermososYo los agarrÃ© con descuento y no me arrepiento de haberlos compradoSon muy lindo y estÃ¡n muy cÃ³modosLas agujetas venÃ\\xadan un poquito manchadas pero es lo de menosAÃºn no he salido con ellos puestos pero me los probÃ© y estÃ¡n geniales Me gustan que sean blancos obviamente se ensucian mucho pero hay que lavarlos y vuelven a quedar como antes Excelente producto Buen diseÃ±o y muy cÃ³modos Muy buen producto Solo que vienen reducidos en tamaÃ±o pidan medio nÃºmero mas grande o hasta el nÃºmero completo EstÃ¡ exactamente como lo querÃ\\xada me encantÃ³ Excelente calidad y llegÃ³ antes del tiempo pactado Totalmente  satisfecho cumple con todo ademÃ¡s de que estÃ¡n mejor que en las fotos El tallaje esta muy bien llegaron antes de lo indicado Excelente artÃ\\xadculo SÃºper cÃ³modos y hermosos These are perfect even for an adultI am a womenâ\\x80\\x99s size 8 I was told thatâ\\x80\\x99s a youth  big kids size 6These fit perfect with like a 12 inch to spare which I like the room in slippersThese were a little hard and stiff out of the box but what slippers arntThese are awesome I love them They are my new favs I have other ugg ones that keep my feet too hot I love these more These are great I recommend them  They will break in with time I love the look I know they will last longer then a 20 pair that break down in a week I wish I could leave photos I am an adult who wears a childs size 3 shoe It is difficult for me to find a very comfortable durable adult looking slipper  These are perfect  They are not too wide like most childrens shoes  I buy My floors are hard and the thick cushioned soles are wonderful to my feet  I will wear them from my living room outdoors to water my patio plants  The suede is durable quality material and water spots just fade away  The fur lining keeps my feet warm as well Even in the summer months my feet stay cold  I praise the manufacturers of these slippers Super cute slippers but much roomier than other UGG scuff slippers  There is no sheepskin on the top underside of the slipper which makes the fit different than other styles  Length is the same Love the leopard print and best of all it is warm and saves my legs from standing on tile Uggâ\\x80\\x99s are my favorite slippers during winter I got a size 6 big kids and I am a size 8 in womenâ\\x80\\x99s They fit perfect I love these so much The only thing the sole is a little hard but over time I know uggs get soft and adapt to your foot So itâ\\x80\\x99s all good Would recommend Super cute high quality UGG slippers with nonslip sole extremely comfortable and stylish Fits true to size There great ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a The footbed is very firm  Returned these to get something with memory foam Unlike other UGG slippers Ive purchased this pair had thin sole and little support My 5 year old loves them'"
